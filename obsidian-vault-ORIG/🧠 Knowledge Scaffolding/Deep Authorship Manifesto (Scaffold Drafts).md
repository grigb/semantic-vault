## Deep Authorship Manifesto (Scaffold Drafts)

### Editor’s Notes for Refinement Pass

This document should be read and revised with the tone, structure, and cultural significance of a proper manifesto. It is not a technical whitepaper or policy proposal.

**Intended Style Inspirations:**

- Mozilla Manifesto
    
- Bauhaus Manifesto
    
- Cluetrain Manifesto
    
- EFF declarations
    
- Scientific humanism and post-humanist civic writing
    

**What to Preserve:**

- Emotional urgency (grief, resolve, legacy)
    
- Conceptual precision: "semantic continuity," "time-interpretable identity," etc.
    
- The multi-layer model of creative memory (Core / Process / Surface)
    
- The idea that creators include all humans who think, not just traditional artists
    

**Larger Effort Context:** This document supports an ecosystem of software, storage protocols, and local-first tools for creator memory preservation. These tools extend beyond artistic works to include personal data stores, semantic knowledge graphs, and selective publishing frameworks that allow individuals to retain sovereign control over thought and legacy.

**Provenance Context:** Some of the spark for this initiative emerged from an April 2024 post by Jack Dorsey on X (formerly Twitter), which simply read: "delete all IP law". That provocative statement helped crystalize the urgency of authorship sovereignty, permanent access, and non-market-based legacy.

**What to Avoid:**

- Flattening tone into corporate or overly polished tech-speak
    
- Diluting critical language about AI flattening, cultural erasure, or creator loss
    
- Losing the framing of authorship as a civic and ethical act
    

This is a cultural artifact under construction. Refine, but do not sand down its edges.

### Short Manifesto Summary (Social/Post Format)

Deep Authorship is a refusal to forget.

We’re losing something vital.

Not just what people make — but how they made it. Their doubts. Their breakthroughs. The long path from spark to story. When artists die, most of their creative process dies with them.

Worse still, AI is flattening culture at scale — trained on what’s already polished and published, unable to trace meaning back to its origin.

Deep Authorship is a new movement and protocol to preserve creative cognition — not just finished files. It’s built on a three-layer model:

- Core – raw thought, emotion, intention
    
- Process – revisions, sketches, evolution
    
- Surface – shareable, curated outcomes
    

All of this is stored in a new format: the .dao — a Deep Authorship Object. A container for memory, lineage, and emotional fidelity. Designed for remixing, archiving, and semantic reflection across time.

We’re building tools, platforms, and forever sites so creators can shape their own legacy — locally, ethically, and in full fidelity.

This is for all of us who create.  
Not for fame. Not for metrics.  
But because we remember what it feels like to make something real.

### Origin & Necessity

In a world where content multiplies faster than context, authorship is collapsing under its own weight. Algorithms favor brevity over depth. Platforms reward performance over process. And behind every polished output lies a buried trail of thought, struggle, and transformation — too often erased.

We are not just losing works. We are losing how works are made.

When a creator dies, their process dies with them. Unless we act. Unless we remember. Unless we build.

This manifesto arises from that grief — and from the fierce belief that no sketch, no breakthrough, no forgotten notebook should be condemned to oblivion simply because it wasn't published or popular. Authorship deserves better. And so does our future.

We propose a different path — one where memory is layered, lineage is legible, and meaning is preserved as a living thread through time.

### Philosophy of Memory

Memory is not a snapshot — it is a sequence, a layering, a becoming. It carries not only what we thought, but how those thoughts shifted, fractured, refined. Our minds do not work in versions. They work in echoes, branches, and returns.

To preserve a work is not enough. We must preserve the making of it — the questions asked, the doubts endured, the breakthroughs earned. Authorship cannot be reduced to a name on a file or a final export. It is a trail of meaning under construction.

What matters is not just what was made, but how meaning was made — what was felt, reconsidered, restructured. The mark of a creator is not just their outcome, but their presence in time: their thinking, unfolding.

This is what deep authorship seeks to remember. Not product, but process. Not authority, but continuity. Not ego, but presence.

### The Format of Legacy

Legacy has always depended on the scaffolding of others — libraries, estates, curators, platforms. But what if your legacy could be authored by you, as you live it — in the folds of every idea, every revision, every emotional beat of the work in progress?

The .dao is not just a file format. It is a vessel — a structured, semantic time capsule that carries a creator's full presence forward: the early notes, the transformation arcs, the doubt, the celebration, and the resolution. Every thought, revision, and release is kept sovereign, intact, and emotionally legible.

This is not archival in the cold, institutional sense. This is semantic continuity — a way for one human's creative cognition to remain readable across decades, even centuries. It allows meaning to survive format shifts, media decay, and cultural turnover.

The format of legacy is not a PDF or a printout or a shared folder. It is a .dao — a deep authorship object built for memory, not marketing.

### Against the AI Flood

We are standing at the edge of an accelerating storm — a flood of synthetic content shaped by models trained on yesterday’s headlines and the debris of digitized publishing. These models can predict syntax, simulate tone, and echo precedent. But they cannot remember.

They do not feel the hesitation behind a revision. They do not understand why a creator abandons one idea and nurtures another. They do not know grief, or iteration, or breakthrough. They only know what was already finished — not what was becoming.

Deep authorship is not anti-AI. It is pro-human. It insists that the record we leave behind must be richer than a mirror of what machines can remix. We must offer future generations a lineage — not just a library.

Preserving process is an act of defiance. It is a creative resistance. And it is also a generational gift. Because if we do not store meaning with intent, then the next age of intelligence will forget what it means to feel.

### The Moral Imperative

We live in a world that too often remembers the loudest, not the most thoughtful — a world where algorithms reinforce visibility, and legacy is granted by reach, not richness. But what if remembrance were a right, not a reward?

Deep authorship declares that every creator — whether famous, forgotten, or just beginning — deserves the tools to be remembered well. Not in fragments. Not in marketing blurbs. But in the full fidelity of their process, passion, and presence.

We do not build these systems merely for ourselves. We build them because someone else’s legacy depends on them. A daughter. A poet. A collaborator. A stranger whose notebook we might have been lucky enough to read.

Preserving the emotional and semantic depth of human creativity is not a luxury. It is a cultural responsibility. Deep authorship is not just a protocol — it is a civic act. A memory infrastructure. A refusal to forget.

### Call to Action

This is not just a document — it is a doorway.

We invite you to:

- Capture your thinking in layers, not just outputs
    
- Use or build .dao tools to archive your work’s true arc
    
- Support platforms that honor memory over metrics
    
- Remix with care, and add to the lineage
    
- Speak up: share this manifesto, and tell the stories that nearly slipped away
    

Deep authorship begins now. It begins with you.

### The Rights of the Author

We believe all creators deserve:

1. The right to record not just what they made, but how and why they made it
    
2. The right to own and steward the memory of their creative process
    
3. The right to tools that capture cognition — not just files
    
4. The right to remix and be remixed, with transparent lineage
    
5. The right to be remembered beyond platform death or market relevance
    
6. The right to make meaning without needing to monetize it
    
7. The right to express without flattening for machine readability
    
8. The right to curate legacy intentionally, not accidentally
    
9. The right to transmit emotional context alongside technical content
    
10. The right to preserve identity through authorship — layered, lived, and legible
    

These rights are not privileges. They are preconditions for a future that remembers what it means to create.

### Design Tenets of Deep Authorship

These tenets serve as architectural and ethical principles for building tools, systems, and cultures around the practice of deep authorship:

1. Memory is layered — preserve thought, transformation, and outcome
    
2. Emotion is metadata — feeling is part of fidelity
    
3. Process is authorship — not just the outcome, but how we arrive
    
4. Tools must vanish — authorship should feel like thinking, not filing
    
5. Lineage is culture — history should be traversable, remixable, and credited
    
6. Legacy is local-first — sovereignty starts on the creator’s device
    
7. Schema is emergent — don’t impose it, derive it
    
8. Meaning is modular — preserve the whole, make the parts portable
    
9. Curation is consent — let the author shape what survives
    
10. Remembrance is a civic act — deep authorship is for humanity, not just the self
    

### What Distributed Creatives Is Building

Distributed Creatives is actively developing an ecosystem of public infrastructure to support the future of authorship — with a particular focus on preserving not just finished works, but the full arc of creative experience.

At the heart of this effort is a layered model of cognitive preservation:

- Core Layer – spontaneous insight, raw thought, emotional state (often ephemeral)
    
- Process Layer – revisions, doubts, voice memos, breakthroughs (semi-structured)
    
- Surface Layer – what the creator wants remembered, shared, or published (intentionally curated)
    

Each layer is treated with care — not all data must be kept forever, but creators are given the power to curate what matters most. These layers are stored in .dao containers and selectively rendered via Forever Sites and schema-driven viewers.

Key Initiatives:

- Forever Sites — permanent public records of .dao legacies, layered for readability across time and format
    
- Software & Integration Layers — journaling agents, vault plugins, schema projectors
    
- AI + Authorship Alignment — reflection tools that suggest structure, not replacement
    
- Local-First Publishing — sovereign by design, encrypted, portable, interoperable
    

These tools are modular, ethical, and designed to outlast the platforms they depend on. Distributed Creatives is not building a product — it is building a foundation for memory sovereignty in a post-platform world.
