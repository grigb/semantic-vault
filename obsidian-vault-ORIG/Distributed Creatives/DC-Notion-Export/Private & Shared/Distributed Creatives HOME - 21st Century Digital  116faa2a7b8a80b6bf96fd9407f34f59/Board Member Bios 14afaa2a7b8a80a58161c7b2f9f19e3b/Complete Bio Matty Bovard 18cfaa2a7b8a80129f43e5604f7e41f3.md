*Co-Founder & Board Member, Distributed Creatives*

## Professional Overview

Matty Bovard stands at the intersection of artistic innovation and community empowerment, bringing over fifteen years of experience in creative production, cultural organization, and digital transformation to his role at Distributed Creatives. His work bridges traditional artistic practices with emerging technologies, always focused on creating sustainable opportunities for artists and fostering vibrant creative communities.

## Early Influences & Education

Growing up in Fairfield, Iowa provided Matty with a unique perspective on cultural integration and community building. The town represented a remarkable synthesis of rural Midwestern farm life and international influence through the Transcendental Meditation movement, exposing him to diverse worldviews from an early age. This environment, where conservative agricultural lifestyles coexisted with progressive artistic and spiritual pursuits, laid the foundation for his later work in building bridges between different cultural frameworks and economic models.

Raised in a household where creativity was paramount—his parents operated one of the world's premier stained glass studios both were also artists in their own right—Matty developed an early appreciation for the practical aspects of sustaining artistic practices. The combination of his mother's Roman Catholic faith and his parents' mutual engagement with Transcendental Meditation demonstrated the possibility of harmonizing seemingly divergent worldviews, a theme that would become central to his community-building work.

His formal education at the University of Iowa, where he earned a B.A. in Theater and a minor in English (2009), provided technical training in performance and literary arts while offering opportunities to explore the relationship between artistic expression and social change. During this period, Matty began developing his unique approach to poetry and performance, influenced by the legacy of the Beat Generation writers and their integration of artistic practice with social transformation.

## Community Building & Event Production

### Early Initiatives (2009-2011)

Following his graduation, Matty launched "Knew Evolution," a magazine designed to serve as a focal point for creative community building. This project, supported by his father with cost of printing paid for as a college graduation present, represented his first attempt at creating a platform for artistic collaboration and community engagement. The publication's name—emphasizing both evolution and revolution—reflected his vision of gradual but fundamental cultural transformation through artistic expression.

During this period, he also began organizing poetry events and open mics in Iowa City, building connections with the Minneapolis art scene and developing his understanding of the challenges facing artists in smaller cultural centers. His work with the Evolver network introduced him to new models of community organization around progressive cultural initiatives.

### Boulder Period (2011-Present)

### StarWater Wednesdays (2013-2020)

After relocating to Boulder in 2011, Matty co-founded what would become one of his most significant contributions to the local creative ecosystem. The StarWater Wednesday series, running for seven years, it brought together different elements of the arts and intellectual ideas featuring a live interview, an open mic and featured acts. It grew into a vital platform for artistic collaboration and community building. The event's success demonstrated his ability to create sustainable frameworks for creative expression while building lasting relationships between artists and venues.

### Festival Integration & Programming

As Poetry Coordinator for ARISE Music Festival (2013-2014), Matty pioneered new approaches to integrating spoken word performance into festival environments. His curation brought together established figures like Anne Waldman with emerging voices, creating unprecedented opportunities for poetic expression in festival settings. He developed a model for wandering performers that activated different spaces throughout the festival grounds, demonstrating innovative approaches to artistic programming.

### Radio Broadcasting (2021-2023)

In partnership with legendary event producer Buddha Bomb of Family Moons, Matty established a proof-of-concept internet radio station under the Knew rEvolution banner. Broadcasting from North Boulder, he produced biweekly four-hour shows every Sunday that exemplified his vision for community-driven media. Each broadcast combined two hours of original music, one hour from his extensive community of artists and one hour from urban New Orleans hosted by Ayana Molina, with two hours of talk radio, covering a wide spectrum of topics including alternative medicine, artist interviews, psychedelic philosophy, and cultural commentary.
This project, which continued until Buddha Bomb's passing on his 72nd birthday in February 2023, demonstrated the potential for community-driven media platforms. The extensive archive of recordings and vast catalog of original music from his network of artists represents a significant documentation of Boulder's creative community during this period. 

## Digital Innovation & Economic Models

### Web3 Initiatives (2021-Present)

Recognizing the potential of blockchain technology to create new economic opportunities for artists, Matty began exploring NFTs and decentralized organizational models in early 2021. His experience attempting to create sustainable revenue streams through traditional digital platforms (Instagram, Patreon, Amazon) informed his approach to Web3 technologies, focusing on creating genuine value for artists and their communities rather than speculative markets.

### Vision for Digital Community

Through his work with Distributed Creatives, Matty is developing comprehensive systems for artist empowerment that combine physical community building with digital infrastructure. His approach emphasizes:

- Creating direct relationships between artists and their supporters
- Building sustainable revenue models that prioritize artist autonomy
- Fostering collaboration across artistic disciplines
- Developing technical solutions that serve creative communities
- Establishing frameworks for community-driven funding and support

## Performance & Artistic Practice

Matty's own artistic practice serves as a laboratory for testing new approaches to creative expression and community engagement. His 13-hour continuous poetry performance at Vision Quest (October 2020) demonstrated both his artistic endurance and his commitment to pushing creative boundaries. This marathon performance, documented and available on YouTube, represented a public declaration of his dedication to artistic practice as a vehicle for social transformation.

His performance style, described as "aggressive nonviolence," combines elements of Beat poetry, prankster tradition, and spiritual practice. This approach allows him to engage with challenging social issues while maintaining a spirit of inclusion and possibility, reflecting his vision of art as a tool for healing social divisions.
