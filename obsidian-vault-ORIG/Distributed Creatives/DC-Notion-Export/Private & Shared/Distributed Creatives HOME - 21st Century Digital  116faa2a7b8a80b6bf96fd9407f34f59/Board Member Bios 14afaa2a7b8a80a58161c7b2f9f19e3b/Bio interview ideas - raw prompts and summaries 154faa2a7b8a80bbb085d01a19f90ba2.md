# Bio interview ideas - raw prompts and summaries

make sure it’s clear about extracting information that will prove to grantors that the members are trustworthy, and due to their experience with previous grants, will provide the followup and results needed, and due to their experience with culture will do what’s best for creatives and due to their  professional experience, can deliver technically accurate and groundbreaking results.

This is a good start, but add questions for an understanding of the diversity of their background. For example their artistic/creative experience, what styles they like, what they dreams of doing before they became busy adults. What they hope to do outside of work requirements, where they want to see the world go.  For example, I usually talk about my programming and some music experience, but in fact I have a 30 year history of accomplishments. I rarely have the opportunity to tell the full story of all the art, life experience, travels, people i’ve met, projects I’ve completed, etc
