Working artists drive economic development at every level (national, regional, municipal, and district).

The Arts Industry Contributes Greatly to the GDP
The arts and culture sector contributed approximately $804 billion to the US economy in 2016. The average annual growth of the arts and culture sector is 4.2%, as of that time. Independent artists, writers, and performers contributed $22 billion to the US economy in 2016.

Commercial Arts Activity Generates $ for Urban Economies
According to research conducted by the New York–based organizations Alliance for the Arts and R.Dot, nonprofit and commercial arts activity “generates $17.7 billion annually for the Big Apple.” —Project for Public Spaces, How Art Economically Benefits Cities (2008)

Rural Area Arts Industry Brings in Money from Out-of-State
“The arts are often overlooked when states are focusing on economic development,” but data shows that the arts sector contributes greatly to the economy. Though no comprehensive state-level research exists, a Montana study shows that the arts had an economic impact of $233 million, with 77% of goods sold to out-of-state buyers. —Montana State University, The Economic Impact of Montana
Artists (2005)

Arts Industry–generated Activities Are Central to Tourism Interest & Revenue
In a survey by the Joint Legislative Committee on Cultural Affairs, 99% of the chief executive officers questioned stated that the availability of cultural activities in an area are an important consideration in choosing a new location. 65% of American adult travelers say that they have included a cultural, arts, heritage, or historic activity or event while on a trip of 50 miles or more (one-way) in the past
year. —Project for Public Spaces, How Art Economically Benefits Cities (2008)

A Flourishing Arts Economy Strengthens Other Industries in the Same Region
A study highlighting artist education in German-speaking countries reported that the cultural and creative industries have an immense impact on other sectors of the economy such as tourism: “In Austria culture has become a stronger direct contributor to wealth than tourism.” —Cogent Education, Educating artists in management – An analysis of art education programs in DACH region (2006)

Impact on Tax Revenues Is Also Net Positive
In England, for instance “Every £1 of targeted public arts funding returns £5 in tax...the contribution of arts and culture to the economy has grown fastest in regions that have been struggling to recover from the recession.”—Arts Council England, Contribution of the arts and
culture industry to the national economy (2015)

Thriving Artists Become Self-Fueled Re-investors in the Economy
An Idaho study shows that artists reinvested their earnings back into their art: “Many artists reported reinvesting the revenue they gained from selling their work back into their artistic practice, a business practice that is commonly seen across many entrepreneurial fields like business start-ups and angel investing.”—Boise State University School of Public Service, The Working Artist (2015)

Arts education and cultural programming, such as museums and art exhibitions,
improve quality of life and reduce crime—the social economy of an area.

Crime rates go down when citizens have access to arts education, art events, and art.
—Crain’s New York, Crime found to be lower in NYC neighborhoods with arts institutions (2017)

“Research suggests that arts education contributes to the development of cognitive processes and
prosocial skills that are especially significant for justice-involved or high-risk populations (Yahner
et al., 2015).

In a study that employed four large, national datasets, [Catterall, Dumais, and
Hampden Thompson (2012)] found that at-risk youth with high levels of arts engagement had
more positive outcomes in several areas that correspond to important protective factors for
justice-system involvement—including school performance and civic engagement beyond the arts
(Yahner et al., 2015). Several smaller studies of arts-based programs for court-involved youth also
demonstrated potential benefits ranging from reduced negative behaviors and more effective
emotional communication (Yahner et al., 2015; Center for Youth and Communities, 2009; DeCarlo
and Hockman, 2003) to reduced recidivism (Ezell and Levy, 2003).” —Urban Institute, Examining
the Ways Arts & Culture Intersect with Public Safety (2016)

There is a clear correlation between cultural engagement and community well-being.
—Demonstrated by research from the University of Pennsylvania’s Social Impact of the Arts
Project “Artists are central, notperipheral, to social change.”
—Creative Time Reports, Change the Culture, Change the World (2013)

“Leaders who care about community and economic development can feel good
about choosing to invest in the arts.”
—Robert L. Lynch, President and CEO, Americans for the Arts

Despite attitudinal benefits, most artists do not make a sustainable living
from their art business, which drives them into other professional practices.
Fewer than 10% of art-school graduates “make their primary earnings as
working artists” —BFA,MFA,PhD, Artists Report Back (2014)

Career Dilution and Dissonance
The Center for an Urban Future found that 11% of creative workers in New York City were “employed
outside of creative industries” in 2013. —Impact of the Arts on New York City’s Economy

In a survey of CHF’s Art-Business Accelerator™ Fellows, only 30% of professional artists initially reported deriving 100% of their income from their art businesses. (Their
participation in the program has boosted that percentage.) An economic study of professional artists in Australia found that over one-third of all artists have, at some
time, put their creative artistic skills to use in another industry outside the arts. —Making Art Work: An Economic Study of Professional Artists in Australia (2017)
