» Organizational Background «

Founded in 2024, Distributed Creatives (DC) is dedicated to transforming how artists cultivate sustainable careers in the digital age. Unlike commercial platforms that exploit creators, we operate as a nonprofit, committed to enhancing Boulder's creative infrastructure for the collective benefit of our community.

Our founding team brings over 13 years of experience within Boulder's vibrant art scene, complemented by more than 30 years of combined expertise in nurturing creative communities globally. We are focused on developing the Local Artist Network (LAN) and the Musely ecosystem.

At DC, we recognize the significant challenges artists encounter in achieving economic sustainability. Our mission is to make the arts accessible to all community members, ensuring that everyone can engage with and benefit from creative opportunities. By championing local artists and promoting inclusivity, we aim to foster a dynamic cultural environment that enriches our community and enhances the quality of life for all its residents.

Goals: At Distributed Creatives (DC), our mission is to seamlessly connect the physical and digital realms to empower local artists. Through our Local Artist Network (LAN) and Musely.social platform, we transform venue displays—such as screens in cafes and theaters—into dynamic showcases for local talent. This innovative approach enables audiences to experience art and performances while easily supporting the creators behind them, fostering a culture of ongoing patronage. In the initial phase of our initiative, we will implement measurable goals to ensure our impact is tangible and effective:

1. Launch Digital Creation Tools

We aim to introduce tools that allow artists to create and sell unique digital items, including NFTs, within the first six months. Our target is to onboard at least 50 local artists to utilize these tools by the end of the first year.

2. Establish Technological Infrastructure

We will set up the necessary technology to support our efforts, including AI-powered analytics for tracking audience engagement. Our goal is to install this infrastructure in at least 10 local venues within the first year, achieving a minimum of 1,440 daily impressions per venue.

3.Build Venue Partnerships

We plan to partner with at least 15 local venues by the end of the first year. These partnerships will facilitate the integration of our platform into their existing systems, ensuring that local talent is prominently featured and supported.

As a nonprofit organization, we are committed to collaborating with all cultural and community groups to enhance their efforts and broaden their reach. Our goal is to ensure that every segment of our community benefits from the creative energy we cultivate, ultimately leading to a more vibrant and inclusive cultural landscape in Boulder.

» Current Programs of Distributed Creatives «

Distributed Creatives (DC) is dedicated to transforming the creative landscape in Boulder through innovative programs that enhance community engagement with the arts. Our flagship initiative, the Local Artist Network (LAN), is set to launch in 2025 and will serve as a dynamic platform for local creators, providing them with unprecedented visibility and support.

» Local Artist Network (LAN) «

The LAN uses high quality displays strategically placed in various venues across Boulder, averaging 1,440 daily impressions per location. This program is designed to showcase local creators of all kinds, dedicating 70% of display time to their content.

Through the LAN, we anticipate reaching a broad audience, including:

- Local Creators: Hundreds of artists and performers will benefit from increased visibility and opportunities for engagement.

- Enhanced Community Engagement: The program will foster a deeper connection between creators and the community, encouraging participation in cultural events and initiatives.
- Economic Growth: By driving traffic to local venues and promoting cultural tourism, we expect to see increased revenue for participating businesses and job creation in the creative sector.
- Cultural Enrichment: The LAN will contribute to a vibrant cultural landscape in Boulder, enhancing the overall quality of life for residents and visitors alike.

In addition to the LAN, our Musely.social platform will revolutionize how creators monetize their work, offering integrated features such as ticketing, direct support mechanisms, digital content sales, and community crowdfunding. This platform will empower creators to thrive economically while fostering a supportive community around the arts.

# **FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS**

Several items in our financials reflect our status as a new nonprofit in the startup phase:

1. The negative working capital position is temporary and expected during our founding year. This will be addressed through committed funding for 2025, including an $8,800 Boulder Arts Commission grant and a $50,000 private benefactor pledge.
2. The significant increase in 2025 expenses represents our planned program expansion, including LAN infrastructure deployment and staffing. This growth is supported by secured funding commitments and substantial in-kind support valued at $81,000 annually from technology partners and volunteer services.
3. The "Due to Founder" liability represents initial startup costs personally funded by the founder for legal registration and basic infrastructure. This will be reimbursed once grant funding is received.

These items reflect normal startup phase operations and our transition from an all-volunteer organization to a funded nonprofit with expanded programming capacity.

# **QUESTION ON FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS**

*385 characters left*

The board has implemented a clear strategy to address our startup-phase deficit and founder loan. Secured commitments for 2025 include an $8,800 Boulder Arts Commission grant,

$50,000 private benefactor pledge, and $81,000 in-kind support. Program revenue will begin in 2025 through venue partnerships, membership fees, and limited sponsorships. Our sustainability model requires only 3,000 members at $10 monthly to achieve positive cash flow. The board reviews financials monthly and adjusts strategies to ensure long-term sustainability while maintaining our mission of providing infrastructure as a public good.

# **QUESTION ON FINANCIAL DOCS: OPERATING RESERVES**

Yes, the board has implemented a policy to establish operating reserves equivalent to three months of expenses once program revenue commences in 2025. We will allocate 10% of our monthly net revenue to these reserves until we reach this target, after which we will maintain this level through quarterly reviews by the board.

As we are currently in the startup phase, we anticipate beginning to build these reserves in 2026, when our projections indicate positive net income.

# **CAPACITY BUILDING**

This grant will enhance Distributed Creatives' (DC) capacity through five key initiatives:

**Accelerating LAN Deployment**: Expanding from two venues to a city-wide digital infrastructure will deliver 1,440 daily impressions per location, dedicating 70% of display time to local creators, marginalized communities, and youth programming.

**Expanding Musely.social Features**: Developing seasonal event passes and smart TV apps will generate sustainable revenue and establish permanent infrastructure for broader access to cultural programming.

**Supporting Cultural Events**: The LAN will bolster existing events and create new opportunities, positioning Boulder as a potential host for Sundance in 2027 and showcasing emerging talent through our LAN Film Festival.

**Implementing Community Services**: We will serve Boulder's diverse populations through alerts, educational content, and multilingual programming, promoting inclusivity and engagement.

These initiatives create a self-sustaining infrastructure that amplifies cultural vitality while reducing future reliance on grants.

# **COMMUNITY PRIORITIES**

We support artists' professional development by connecting creators with opportunities. By joining our network, local artists gain visibility across Boulder's diverse venues, enabling them to build sustainable careers and reach new audiences.

We strengthen Boulder's identity as a unified creative community. Our network of venues serve as a constellation of cultural spaces, showcasing unique aspects of Boulder's artistic diversity. This interconnectedness fosters a cohesive cultural experience, allowing residents to discover performances, exhibitions, and events they might otherwise overlook. We facilitate regular community roundtables to ensure our programming reflects and celebrates Boulder's creative spirit.

We dedicate 70% of our programming to local creators, ensuring space for the cultural heritage of tribal nations, the artistic expressions of youth, and the diverse voices of historically marginalized communities.

Through partnerships, we enrich Boulder's cultural dialogue with diverse perspectives. Transforming public spaces into gateways for creative discovery, guiding residents in exploring the art that flourishes throughout their community. This unified presence makes creativity more accessible ensuring that everyone in Boulder can participate in and benefit from our vibrant ecosystem.
