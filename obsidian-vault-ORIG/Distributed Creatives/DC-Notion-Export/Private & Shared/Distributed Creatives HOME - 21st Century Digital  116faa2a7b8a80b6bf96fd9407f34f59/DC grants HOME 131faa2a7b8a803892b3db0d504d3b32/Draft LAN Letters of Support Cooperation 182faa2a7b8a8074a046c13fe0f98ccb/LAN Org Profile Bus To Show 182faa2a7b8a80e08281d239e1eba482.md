## Current role in Boulder's cultural scene

Bus to Show was delivered as part of a strategy to implement systems
 in the past (present) designed to save the future (of existence) by 
reducing the impaired driving (preventing tragic disruptions in the 
trajectory of life energies embodied by future pivotal leaders) and fuel
 consumption  that results from events (acceleration of the consequences
 of climate change).  All you have to do be part of the solution, is 
ride the bus.

Bus to Show is a Colorado Nonprofit Corporation 
with the ability to accept 501(c)(3) tax-exempt donations through its 
fiscal sponsor partnership with The Nowak Society.

The provide education and services to party goers. Topics will include trauma informed practices, creating intentional and supportive spaces, de-escalation, CPR/First Aid, crisis intervention, and the basics of pharmacology. The goal here is to bolster the skill sets of the drivers and chaperones, while furthering the missions of both Bus To Show and The Nowak Society and improving the experiences of the bus riders.

# Current Challenges

- They would like to be more active in the Boulder area and can shuttle people from Denver and surrounding areas to Boulder and back again. However, there are a few opportunities and it's hard to work with local event providers.

## Specific cultural/artistic challenges in their area

- It's hard to stay in the Boulder area and provide shuttle services if there aren't enough events

## Existing participation in community

- **Showing up**:
 Community can only exist when we continuously show up for each other 
and the issues we care about. We value witnessing each other with 
compassion, empathy, and respect, and showing up in support of 
cultivating community.
