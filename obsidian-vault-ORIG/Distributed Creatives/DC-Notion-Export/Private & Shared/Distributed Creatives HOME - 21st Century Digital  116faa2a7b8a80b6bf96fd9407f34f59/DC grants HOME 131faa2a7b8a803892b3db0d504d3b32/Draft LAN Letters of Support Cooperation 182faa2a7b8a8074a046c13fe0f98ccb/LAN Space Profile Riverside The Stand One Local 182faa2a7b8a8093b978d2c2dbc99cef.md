**In the Heart of Boulder…at the Riverside – Polaris Dawn**

The genesis is remembering who we 
are, where we come from, and what we mean to each other; only then can 
we gift our ‘all-in’ and catalyze a new dawn.  The Riverside is gifted 
as a proverbial sandbox for those who choose to go all-in with our 
New-Family model. Through our conscious gift of seeing, loving, and 
valuing people as they are, with hearts connecting, the gift of the 
New-Family sprouts – True family: Fiercely devoted, in a loving 
container, scaled for durability and intimacy, for true connection.

As people are drawn in and onboarded,
 New-Families are birthed and become the building blocks for a 
distributed village of interconnected New-Families within Boulder.  The 
emergent Family-Village is in service to generate local growth and local
 life-giving endeavors, nourishing the Family-Village and Boulder as a 
whole.

We believe that when people who are 
devotionally held in their loving New-Families, maybe for the first 
time, can truly show up.  Such a Family-Village of interdependent and 
fully living all-in people will move the mountains together.

Our initial experiment is aimed at 
developing the New-Family Operating System we lovingly call 
“Familyhood”, which shall be encoded and disseminated through 1World 
Academy.

Our larger vision is one where the 
Family-Villages who share their stories and culture become a Tribe.  
These self-identified Tribes then potentially create global impact 
through gifted access to existing networks, already in search of the 
next expression of humanity and all-life on our beautiful Mother Earth.

*Together we are growing Life, Love
 & Trust – We are here for kindred spirits, souls, partners, and 
sages in service to humanity and our future.*

**1World Academy:**

An Academy inspired by the guilds of 
old; where masters and apprentices work together, learn together, and 
grow together, in a heart-centered and focused way. We are, however, 
adding a surprise: the element of dynamic leadership, where the masters 
and apprentices are also practicing de-personalized leadership. This 
type of leadership is not defined by title, age, wealth, or status, but 
by listening to what wants to be expressed next and then supporting the 
source of that expression, without second guessing – put simply: We 
follow the natural flow of the project/work, not a person.

Also, the 1World Academy is an 
Academy of Academies, where in addition to running our academy, masters 
from all over the world are also drawn in to share their wisdom while 
alchemizing with the embedded wisdom and energy held at the Riverside. 
All of this synthesizes as something new, something life is asking for, 
something being birthed here in the heart of Boulder.

**1Team Coordination HUB:**

From The Academy, is emerging an 
ecosystem of projects, teams, and skillful people who share an 
underlying support system: Familyhood, and the 1Team operating systems. 
 1Team systems and technologies are inspired by the Fire Department’s 
trainings, brotherhood, and incident command systems, but in a more 
unified way, combined with innovations like job-boards, resource & 
skills sharing, and points incentivization.

With the shared culture and coding, 
the projects, jobs, resources, and people will be coordinated in a more 
dynamic self-governing way, where the participants are the authority on 
where and why they choose to apply their life force energies.  We 
already have the system in beta-form being tested and grown, called “The
 Liberty Game”.

The coordination HUB will reveal the 
six-dimensional integral audit of each project and account for the 
outcomes, showing the higher potentiality being generated.  This system 
also already exists through the work of Dr. David Martin’s “Breathing 
Enterprise”.

We also launched the BBF – Boulder 
Business Familyhood, aimed at supporting existing Boulder-owned and 
operated businesses, organizations, and movements to create a network of
 shared support to strengthen our local communities (all-incomes, 
all-ages, all-races, all-sexes, all-of-us), by conscripting Boulderites 
to prioritize supporting local-everything.

Key Technologies used and offered:

- HUG QAs – Asking the question: “Why are you here?” in the context of individuals or groups joining a bigger group or project.
- Cuddlestones: Reconsecration of purpose, sharing inner longing for new outcomes, and
receiving insights and support from the group gathered.
- Purpose Circles – A technology to bring a specific question/topic to a
hand-selected group of people already on a quest aligned with the reason for the circle, bringing to bear group intelligence.
- Living Garden of Interconnected Projects: Calibrating emergent projects to
their purpose and interconnectedness with an ecosystem of projects
enabling resource sharing, momentum building, and eliminating
duplication of efforts – optimization to create more impact!
