# Potential Bloom Network Collaboration

bloomnetwork.earth

Bloom Network is a place based social media platform that provides support for local communities to organize around regenerative action. They recently released a feature on the platform that pays communities for local regenerative action they’re doing. The funding comes from grants and they’re currently running their second round on gitcoin. 

Currently the funding focuses on actions related to working the land, remediation/clean up etc..etc… I’m the lead organizer for the Boulder chapter and have been in touch with team about the possibility of getting paid for more creative event production vs more land based actions. They’re into it but it’s not on their priorities list.

I’m thinking we could have this be one of the grantee’s on the DC gitcoin round to provide funds for the Bloom Chapters to get paid out for creative event production.
