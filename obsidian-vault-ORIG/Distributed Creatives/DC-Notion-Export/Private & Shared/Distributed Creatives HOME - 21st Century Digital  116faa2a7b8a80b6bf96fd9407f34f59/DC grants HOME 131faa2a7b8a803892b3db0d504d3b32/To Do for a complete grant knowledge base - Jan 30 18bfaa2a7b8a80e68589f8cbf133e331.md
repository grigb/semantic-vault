        ### **High Priority**
        
        1. **Technical Architecture**
            - **Platform Specifications**: Musely is built on Wordpress with PeepSo, a robust white-label social network platform tailored for creative communities. Initial specifications include a modular architecture that supports groups, pages, file sharing, and personal profiles.
            - **Security Protocols**: We aim to adapt to a dynamic technological landscape, balancing traditional centralized encryption methods with decentralized security approaches to ensure both flexibility and user protection.
            - **Integration Capabilities**: Musely will initially integrate with the Local Artists Network (LAN) and all platforms within the Fediverse that utilize Bluesky's AT protocol.
            - **Scalability Plan**: The platform will scale as active user engagement and storage demands increase. Our approach includes perfecting a self-sustaining model in Boulder, CO, which will then be expanded to other communities. By supporting existing creative communities and physical establishments without co-opting them, we maintain a lean overhead while maximizing scalability.
        2. **User Experience**
            - **Feature Set Documentation**: Musely’s non-negotiable features include file sharing, groups, pages, and user profiles, all designed to foster collaboration and community engagement.
            - **User Interface Designs**: The PeepSo layout will be adapted and branded as Musely to ensure consistency, usability, and an intuitive user experience.
            - **Accessibility Compliance**: *Could you clarify which compliance standards (e.g., WCAG 2.1 or others) are most relevant? This will guide how we design to meet accessibility needs.  (I don’t know the answer to this) @Grig B*
            - **Mobile Responsiveness Plans**: The initial rollout will focus on a responsive website optimized for mobile use, leveraging PeepSo’s inherent mobile-friendly design.
        3. **Community Management**
            - **Content Guidelines**: Our content guidelines are still in development, prioritizing an inclusive and creative space that encourages artistic expression while maintaining community standards.
            - **Moderation Policies**: Moderation will employ a combination of human oversight and AI-powered tools to ensure effective, fair, and efficient content management.
            - **User Support Systems**: We plan to implement a ticketing system alongside an AI-driven chat integration to provide responsive and scalable user support.
            - **Community-Building Strategies**: Community engagement will include regular events such as networking opportunities, art showcases, and LAN-integrated activities. We will organize contests, guerilla art performances around Boulder, and a series of shows at the downtown band shell. Additionally, we’re building a relationship with BusToShow to offer shuttle services to Boulder’s art districts which will enhance accessibility. Revenue generated will be reinvested into the creative community to ensure sustained growth and support.
            
            ### **Medium Priority**

                - **Feature Release Schedule**: We plan to release the core features (file sharing, groups, pages, and profiles) during the initial platform launch. Subsequent updates will enhance user customization, LAN integration, and Fediverse connectivity.
                - **Testing Protocols**: A phased testing approach will be implemented, starting with internal team testing, followed by small-group beta testing with artists and creative community leaders. Feedback loops will ensure continuous improvement.
                - **Beta Program Details**: A limited beta program will invite Boulder-based creatives, local venues, and art enthusiasts to test Musely. This program will focus on gathering real-world feedback and fine-tuning features before public launch.
                - **Launch Strategy**: The platform will launch with a combination of community-driven events, targeted outreach to LAN members, and partnerships with local venues and art organizations. Marketing efforts will highlight the unique integration of digital and physical creative ecosystems in Boulder.
            2. **Integration Plans**
                - **LAN System Connectivity**: Musely will seamlessly integrate with LAN, offering users access to curated local artist networks, event promotion tools, and community engagement features.
                - **Payment Processing**: The platform will support secure payment processing for memberships, event tickets, and creative transactions, ensuring a user-friendly and trustworthy experience.
                - **Analytics Implementation**: We will implement analytics to provide insights into user engagement, content trends, and platform performance. This data will guide iterative improvements and community-building efforts.
                - **Cross-Platform Sharing**: Musely will support sharing content across Fediverse platforms using Bluesky's AT protocol and expand to support other open social protocols, enabling users to amplify their creative work across decentralized networks.
