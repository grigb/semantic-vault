# A Declaration for Creators in the Digital Age

# A Declaration for Creators in the Digital Age

## Introduction

We stand at a pivotal moment in history. The digital revolution has transformed how creative work is made, shared, and valued—bringing unprecedented opportunities alongside new forms of exploitation. Creators across all disciplines face mounting challenges: AI systems trained on our work without permission or compensation, complex value chains that direct profits away from those who create, platforms that control access to audiences, and technological systems designed to replace rather than empower human creativity.

Despite these challenges, we envision a future where creators thrive through fair compensation, ownership of their work, and meaningful connections with their audiences. We see a creative ecosystem built on transparency, choice, and respect—where technology empowers rather than exploits. We envision sustainable creative careers protected by appropriate safeguards, where AI and other technologies serve creators rather than replace them, and where the value generated from creative works flows primarily to those who create them.

This declaration establishes the founding principles of Distributed Creatives, a global community dedicated to building this future through collective advocacy, technological innovation, and mutual support.

## Core Principles

### 1. United Creator Voice

We unite creators across all disciplines—from visual artists and musicians to writers, performers, and knowledge creators—to amplify our collective power while respecting the unique needs of each creative field. Too long have we been divided into separate silos, weakening our influence and allowing exploitation to flourish. Together, we partner with discipline-specific organizations to strengthen the entire creator ecosystem, building bridges where walls once stood.

### 2. Technology in Service of Creativity

We develop practical technological solutions that empower creators to maintain ownership of their work, track its usage, receive fair compensation, and preserve their creative legacy. Our tools address immediate needs while supporting long-term career sustainability. We reject technologies designed to replace human creativity and instead build systems that augment and protect it, ensuring technology serves creators rather than exploiting them.

### 3. Fair Value Exchange

We advocate for systems where the economic and cultural value generated by creative works flows primarily to their creators. Fair compensation isn't just about higher percentages—it's about restructuring how creative work is valued, licensed, and monetized across all platforms. We stand against the exploitation of creative works for AI training without permission or fair compensation, and we develop frameworks for ethical usage that respects creator rights while enabling innovation.

### 4. Creator Sovereignty and Autonomy

We defend the right of creators to determine how their work is used, shared, and monetized. We build frameworks that give creators control over their intellectual property and their relationships with audiences, free from exploitative platforms and intermediaries. Creator sovereignty means the power to choose—whether to release work for free, license it conditionally, or reserve all rights—remains with the creator, not corporations or algorithms.

### 5. Transparent and Accessible Ecosystem

We promote clear, understandable terms for creative work and build systems that make both creating and accessing creative content more equitable. We believe knowledge and creativity should be accessible while ensuring creators are fairly compensated. We reject opaque contracts, hidden algorithms, and complex systems designed to obscure how creative work is used and valued. Instead, we build transparent frameworks that creators can understand without teams of lawyers.

### 6. Global Community, Local Impact

We build connections among creators worldwide while supporting community-based initiatives that address local needs. We recognize that creator challenges vary by region and culture, requiring both global advocacy and localized solutions. Our distributed structure ensures voices from all communities are represented in our governance and priorities, preventing the concentration of power in any single region or discipline.

### 7. Legacy and Preservation

We develop infrastructure for preserving creative works for future generations, ensuring continued attribution and compensation. Unlike current archival approaches vulnerable to corporate decisions or platform changes, our distributed solutions maintain permanent access with proper licensing intact. We believe creative legacies are too important to be left to commercial platforms that may change policies or disappear entirely.

## Membership Statement

By joining Distributed Creatives, you become part of a global community working to transform how creative work is valued, protected, and shared in the digital age. Our membership model provides both individual benefits and collective advocacy power.

As a member, you gain access to:

- Technological tools for managing, protecting, and monetizing your creative work
- Educational resources about contracts, rights, and business development
- Legal templates and guidance specific to your creative discipline
- A community of fellow creators for support, collaboration, and knowledge sharing
- Direct representation in advocacy efforts with platforms, policymakers, and industry

Most importantly, your membership strengthens our collective voice. Like how SAG-AFTRA Foundation serves over 160,000 performing artists with both emergency assistance and career development resources, or how ASCAP represents more than 960,000 music creators while fighting for their rights to fair compensation, we balance immediate creator support with long-term structural change. We build on the cross-disciplinary approach pioneered by the Creative Commons while adding technological solutions and fair compensation frameworks that address gaps in the current creator advocacy landscape. We believe that by uniting creators across disciplines—from authors and artists to musicians, performers, filmmakers, and knowledge creators—we can create a more sustainable, equitable creative ecosystem for all.

We offer free individual membership to ensure all creators can participate, with tiered support options for those able to contribute financially. Organizations representing creators can join through our partnership program, amplifying their impact through our technological infrastructure and global network.

## Call to Action
