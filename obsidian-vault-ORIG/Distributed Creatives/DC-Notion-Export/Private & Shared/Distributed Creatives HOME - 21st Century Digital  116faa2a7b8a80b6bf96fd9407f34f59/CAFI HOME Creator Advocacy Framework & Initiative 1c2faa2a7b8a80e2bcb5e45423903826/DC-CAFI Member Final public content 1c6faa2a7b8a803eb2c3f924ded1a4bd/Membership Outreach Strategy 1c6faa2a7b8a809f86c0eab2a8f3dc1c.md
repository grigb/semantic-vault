📢 Launching the Declaration for Creators in the Digital Age

In today's digital landscape, creators face unprecedented challenges: AI systems trained on our work without permission, complex value chains directing profits away from creators, and technological systems designed to replace rather than empower human creativity.

After extensive research into over 30 creator advocacy organizations—from the @Authors Guild to the @Electronic Frontier Foundation—we identified critical gaps in the current ecosystem. Most organizations either:
• Focus on a single creative discipline
• Lack technological solutions
• Charge high membership fees
• Address either individual needs OR collective advocacy

Distributed Creatives addresses these gaps through seven core principles that unite creators across all disciplines while providing both practical tools and effective advocacy.

Read the full Declaration and join our movement: [LINK]

3. Cross-disciplinary connections showing common challenges

**Sample Strategy:**
Create a series featuring diverse creators across disciplines discussing a common challenge (e.g., AI training, fair compensation) and how Distributed Creatives' approach helps them. Each video would be 60-90 seconds, featuring the creator in their workspace explaining their experience and ending with a consistent call to action.

**Execution Plan:**

1. Identify 10-15 creators across different disciplines
2. Develop simple filming guidelines for consistent look and feel
3. Create template script structure ensuring key messages
4. Schedule releases twice weekly for maximum engagement
5. Cross-promote between platforms and with featured creators

### Campaign 3: "What Makes Us Different" Educational Series

**Platform Focus:** LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook Groups

**Core Messages:**

1. Educational content on gaps in creator advocacy landscape
2. Direct comparisons with existing organizations
3. Clear value proposition for different creator types

**Sample LinkedIn Post:**

🔍 Creator Organization Deep Dive: The Authors Guild vs. Distributed Creatives

The @Authors Guild has served writers since 1912 with invaluable advocacy and legal support. They provide:
• Contract review services
• Legal advice
• Industry-specific resources
• Collective advocacy for writers

So why do writers also need Distributed Creatives?

Our research found that while discipline-specific organizations like the Authors Guild provide invaluable expertise, 73% of creators now work across multiple disciplines and need support that crosses these boundaries.

Distributed Creatives COMPLEMENTS the Authors Guild by providing:
1. Cross-disciplinary connections to other creator communities
2. Technological tools for managing rights across platforms
3. Preservation infrastructure that survives platform changes
4. Free basic access ensuring all writers can participate

We're not competing with organizations like the Authors Guild—we're creating infrastructure that strengthens the entire creative ecosystem.
