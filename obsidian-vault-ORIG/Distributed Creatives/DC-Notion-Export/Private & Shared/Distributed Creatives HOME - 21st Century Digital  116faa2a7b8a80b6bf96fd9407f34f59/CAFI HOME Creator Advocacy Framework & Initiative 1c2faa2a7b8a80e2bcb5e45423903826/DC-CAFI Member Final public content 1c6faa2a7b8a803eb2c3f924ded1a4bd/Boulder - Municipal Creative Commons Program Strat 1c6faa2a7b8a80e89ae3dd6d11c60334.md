# Boulder - Municipal Creative Commons Program: Strategy and Documentation

# **Municipal Creative Commons Program: Strategy and Documentation**

## **Understanding the Challenge**

Boulder presents a specific opportunity but also challenges for the Municipal Creative Commons Program:

1. They likely receive numerous partnership requests from creative organizations
2. Municipalities are rightfully cautious about new commitments
3. Any proposal needs to clearly demonstrate unique value to the city
4. We need to present something distinctive that will stand out among competing proposals

## **Partnership Strategy for Boulder, Colorado**

### **Phase 1: Research and Alignment**

Before approaching Boulder officials, I recommend:

1. **Research Boulder's Creative Ecosystem**:
    - Study the Boulder Arts Commission strategic plan
    - Review Boulder's Cultural Plan (2015-2024)
    - Analyze existing creative economy initiatives
    - Identify gaps their current programs don't address
2. **Identify Municipal Pain Points**:
    - Economic development challenges post-pandemic
    - Digital infrastructure limitations
    - Creative workforce retention issues
    - Affordable space for creators
    - Equitable access to cultural resources
3. **Align with Existing Priorities**:
    - Connect with Boulder's "Creative Corridor" vision
    - Support their community resilience objectives
    - Address equity goals in creative programming
    - Complement rather than duplicate existing programs

### **Phase 2: Local Coalition Building**

Before approaching the municipality:

1. **Engage Local Creators**:
    - Recruit 10-15 respected Boulder-based creators as initial members
    - Focus on diversity across creative disciplines
    - Prioritize creators with established community connections
    - Develop specific testimonials about local needs
2. **Connect with Established Organizations**:
    - Boulder County Arts Alliance
    - NoBo Art District
    - Boulder International Film Festival
    - Boulder Museum of Contemporary Art
    - University of Colorado's Media Studies department
3. **Create Boulder-Specific Case Study**:
    - Document specific local creator challenges
    - Detail how Distributed Creatives' tools address these challenges
    - Quantify potential economic impact
    - Show complementary relationship with existing programs

### **Phase 3: Initial Contact Strategy**

1. **Warm Introduction Path**:
    - Identify connections to Arts Commission members
    - Seek introduction through Boulder County Arts Alliance
    - Consider University of Colorado faculty connections
    - Engage local business leaders who support the arts
2. **Value-First Approach**:
    - Offer a free digital infrastructure assessment
    - Propose a pilot program with no initial financial commitment
    - Present case studies from similar municipalities (if available)
    - Demonstrate immediate value to local creators
3. **Distinctive Positioning**:
    - Emphasize unique digital infrastructure aspects
    - Focus on year-round support for the creative economy
    - Highlight data collection capabilities that inform policy
    - Present as infrastructure investment, not another event or program

## **Letter of Support Request**

Based on this strategy, here's a draft letter requesting municipal support:

# **Draft Letter of Support Request**

[Date]

[Appropriate Municipal Contact]
City of Boulder
1777 Broadway
Boulder, CO 80302

**Subject: Partnership Opportunity: Municipal Creative Commons Program in Boulder**

Dear [Name],

I'm writing to introduce a unique partnership opportunity that would strengthen Boulder's creative economy through digital infrastructure rather than another program requiring significant municipal resources.

**About Distributed Creatives**

Distributed Creatives is developing digital infrastructure that helps creators maintain ownership of their work, connect directly with audiences, and build sustainable careers. Unlike most creative initiatives that focus on events or programming, we build lasting technological infrastructure that serves creators every day of the year.

**Boulder-Specific Opportunity**

After consulting with [list several local creators and organizations], we've identified specific opportunities to enhance Boulder's creative ecosystem:

1. **Digital Signage Pilot**: We propose a limited pilot program of digital infrastructure that would showcase local creators' work across Boulder without financial commitment from the city.
2. **Creative Economy Metrics**: Our platform would provide valuable data on Boulder's creative economy, helping measure the impact of your cultural investments and inform future policy decisions.
3. **Creator Retention**: Our tools specifically address affordability challenges by helping creators monetize their work more effectively, supporting Boulder's goal of maintaining its creative workforce.
4. **Visitor Engagement**: The digital infrastructure connects visitors with local creative experiences, enhancing Boulder's appeal as a cultural destination.

**What Makes This Different**

We understand Boulder receives many partnership proposals. Our approach is distinctive because:

1. It requires no financial investment from the city for the pilot phase
2. It builds permanent infrastructure rather than temporary programming
3. It serves creators across all disciplines, not just a single sector
4. It provides measurable data on creative economy impact

**What We're Requesting**

We're seeking a letter of support from the City of Boulder that would:

1. Acknowledge the potential value of this partnership
2. Express willingness to explore a limited pilot program
3. Provide permission for initial discussions regarding digital infrastructure

This letter requires no financial commitment, exclusive arrangement, or guaranteed outcome. It simply enables us to begin the conversation and explore how our tools might complement Boulder's existing creative ecosystem.

**Next Steps**

I would welcome the opportunity to present this concept to the appropriate committee or staff members. We've prepared a detailed proposal showing how this initiative aligns with Boulder's Cultural Plan while requiring minimal municipal resources.

Thank you for considering this request. I look forward to discussing how we might contribute to Boulder's thriving creative community.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Your Title]
Distributed Creatives

## **Addressing Common Municipal Concerns**

To prepare for discussions with Boulder officials, here are responses to likely concerns:

### **1. Financial Commitment**

**Concern:** The city can't commit resources to another program.

**Response:** Our pilot requires no financial commitment from Boulder. The initial phase is funded through our organizational resources. Any future resource sharing would only be proposed after demonstrating clear value and ROI.

### **2. Technical Maintenance**

**Concern:** Who maintains the digital infrastructure?

**Response:** Distributed Creatives is responsible for all technical maintenance, updates, and support. The city provides only permission for installation, not ongoing maintenance resources.

### **3. Content Oversight**

**Concern:** Who ensures appropriate content in public spaces?

**Response:** Our platform includes community standards and moderation tools overseen by a joint committee that includes municipal representatives. All content must meet guidelines developed in collaboration with the city.

### **4. Long-term Commitment**

**Concern:** What if the program doesn't work as expected?

**Response:** The partnership agreement includes clear evaluation metrics and exit provisions for both parties. The phased approach allows for adjustment or termination at natural breakpoints without stranding resources.

### **5. Competing Priorities**

**Concern:** How does this relate to our existing initiatives?

**Response:** We've designed our program specifically to complement and enhance existing cultural programming. We provide infrastructure that amplifies the impact of current programs rather than competing with them.

## **Differentiation Strategy**

For municipalities receiving multiple partnership requests, we need to clearly distinguish our offering:

1. **Infrastructure vs. Programming**
    - Most proposals ask for event support or programming funds
    - We offer lasting infrastructure that requires minimal ongoing resources
    - Our approach builds assets rather than expenses
2. **Data-Driven Decision Support**
    - Provide metrics on creative economy impacts
    - Help inform cultural policy with concrete data
    - Measure ROI on existing cultural investments
3. **Distributed Responsibility Model**
    - We maintain the technical infrastructure
    - Content comes from local creators
    - Municipality provides only permission and minimal coordination
    - Shared governance ensures alignment with city values
4. **No Initial Financial Ask**
    - Pilot phase funded entirely by Distributed Creatives
    - Clear metrics before any resource discussion
    - Focus on mutual benefit rather than municipal support

This comprehensive approach acknowledges the challenging environment for new municipal partnerships while offering a distinctive value proposition that addresses real municipal needs with minimal resource requirements. By emphasizing digital infrastructure over programming, data collection capabilities, and no initial financial commitment, we position Distributed Creatives as a unique opportunity that stands out from typical creative sector proposals.
