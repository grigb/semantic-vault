## Notes

The Electronic Frontier Foundation provides an excellent model of how to build an effective advocacy organization at the intersection of technology, law, and civil liberties. Their success in establishing legal precedents and influencing policy while maintaining independence through a diverse funding model is particularly relevant to Distributed Creatives' goals.

EFF's approach to member engagement through both educational resources and practical tools could be adapted by Distributed Creatives to serve creator communities. The ability to translate complex technical and legal concepts into accessible language and resources has been key to EFF's success and would be valuable for DC as well.

While EFF focuses broadly on digital rights, Distributed Creatives has an opportunity to become the definitive voice specifically for creator rights in the digital age, potentially collaborating with EFF where these missions overlap while maintaining a distinct identity focused on creator sovereignty, fair compensation, and long-term preservation.
