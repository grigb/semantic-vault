## Notes

The WGGB has been particularly active in AI policy development, publishing a position paper titled "Writers and AI" in 2023 that acknowledges both risks and potential benefits of AI technology. A survey of their members found 65% believed AI would reduce their income and 61% worried it could replace jobs. The organization has called for independent AI regulation, copyright protections, and compensation for writers whose work is used in AI training.

The WGGB negotiates Minimum Terms Agreements (MTAs) with major industry bodies including BBC TV Drama, BBC Radio Drama, ITV Companies, PACT (independent TV and film producers), theatrical organizations, and streamers like Netflix. These agreements cover minimum fees, advances, repeat fees
