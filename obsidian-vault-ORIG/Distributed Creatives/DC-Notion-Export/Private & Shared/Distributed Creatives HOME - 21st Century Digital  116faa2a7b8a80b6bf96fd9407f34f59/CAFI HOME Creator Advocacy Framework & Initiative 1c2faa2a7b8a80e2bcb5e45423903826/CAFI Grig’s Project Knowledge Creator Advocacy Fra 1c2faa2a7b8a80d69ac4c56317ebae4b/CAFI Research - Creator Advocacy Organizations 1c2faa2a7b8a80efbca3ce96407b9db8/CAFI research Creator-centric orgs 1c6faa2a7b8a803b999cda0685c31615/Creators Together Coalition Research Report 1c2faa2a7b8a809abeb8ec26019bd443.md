## Notes

The Creators Together Coalition represents a focused approach to a specific aspect of creator advocacy: collective bargaining rights for freelance creators. Its strength lies in its clear legislative agenda and policy proposals, as well as its coalition of established creator organizations.

While it operates primarily through member organizations rather than direct individual engagement, it has developed specific legislative proposals to address the fundamental issue of freelance creators' inability to negotiate collectively due to antitrust restrictions.

For Distributed Creatives, the coalition offers both a potential ally in advocacy efforts and a model of how to approach specific policy changes. However, DC's broader technological and community-based approach complements and extends beyond Creators Together's more focused legislative strategy.

The coalition demonstrates the power of uniting different creator disciplines around common economic interests, which aligns with DC's cross-disciplinary vision. At the same time, it highlights the importance of providing concrete value to creators while pursuing longer-term structural changes.
