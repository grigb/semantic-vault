## Notes

Creative Commons represents the most established and widely recognized open licensing framework globally, but focuses primarily on the legal infrastructure rather than comprehensive creator services. This creates an opportunity for Distributed Creatives to build upon this foundation with additional services, technologies, and advocacy that address creator needs beyond licensing alone. The success of CC demonstrates the demand for standardized approaches to sharing creative works while maintaining rights, but gaps remain in economic models, creator sustainability, and technological implementation that DC could potentially address.
