## Notes

The Creative Rights in AI Coalition represents an important example of how cross-disciplinary coordination can create a unified voice in policy discussions. Their focused approach on three key principles allows for clear messaging, though Distributed Creatives' more comprehensive framework offers broader potential impact. The Coalition's formation in direct response to a specific government consultation demonstrates the value of timely advocacy, while its cross-sector membership shows the power of finding common ground across creative disciplines - both lessons Distributed Creatives could apply to its own development.
