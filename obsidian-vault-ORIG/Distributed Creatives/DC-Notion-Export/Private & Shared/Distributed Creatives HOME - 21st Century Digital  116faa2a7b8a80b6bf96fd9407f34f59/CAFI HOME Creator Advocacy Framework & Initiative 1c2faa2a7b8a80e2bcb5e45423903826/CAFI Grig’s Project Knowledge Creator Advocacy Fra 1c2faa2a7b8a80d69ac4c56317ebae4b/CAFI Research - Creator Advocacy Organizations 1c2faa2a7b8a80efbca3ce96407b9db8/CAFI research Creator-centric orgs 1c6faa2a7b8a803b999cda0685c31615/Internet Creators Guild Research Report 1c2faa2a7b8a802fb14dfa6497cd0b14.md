## Notes

The Internet Creators Guild's closure announcement in July 2019 provides important context. The organization stated: "Unfortunately, we have been unable to generate sufficient resources to fulfill our mission. It has become clear that we will be unable to solve that problem in the foreseeable future and so have decided to close." This suggests that while the mission was valid, the execution model—particularly the funding approach—was insufficient.

Distributed Creatives should note that while ICG focused specifically on YouTube and similar platform creators, DC's broader approach to creators across disciplines (including knowledge creators) represents a significant differentiator. Additionally, ICG's limited technological development compared to DC's emphasis on technological solutions (distributed storage, provenance tracking, etc.) represents another key distinction.

The demise of ICG may also indicate that a purely advocacy-focused organization without immediate tangible benefits faces sustainability challenges. DC's dual focus on advocacy and practical technological solutions could address this weakness.
