## Notes

AARP represents a highly successful model of building membership at scale that translates into significant advocacy power. The organization has evolved over time from a retirement-focused group to a comprehensive lifestyle and advocacy organization for anyone 50+.

Several elements of AARP's approach could be valuable for Distributed Creatives:

1. **Membership Value Proposition**: AARP has succeeded by offering immediate tangible benefits (discounts, services, publications) that justify the membership fee, while using the collective power of members to drive advocacy efforts. This "pay for something valuable now, get advocacy power as a bonus" model could work well for creators.
2. **Revenue Diversification**: While membership dues are important, AARP has developed significant revenue from royalties and partnerships. This model allows them to keep membership fees affordable while funding extensive programs and advocacy efforts.
3. **Technological Adaptation**: Despite being founded in the 1950s, AARP has successfully embraced digital transformation, creating mobile apps, online communities, and digital resources while maintaining traditional communication channels.
4. **Brand Clarity**: AARP maintains a clear, consistent message about empowering people to choose how they live as they age. Distributed Creatives would benefit from similarly clear positioning around creator sovereignty and fair compensation.
5. **Organizational Structure**: AARP's structure with a main advocacy organization and specialized subsidiaries (foundation, services, etc.) provides a blueprint for how Distributed Creatives might structure itself to address different aspects of its mission.

The primary challenge in adapting the AARP model is addressing the different needs and motivations of creators versus age-based demographics. While all older adults face similar challenges (healthcare, retirement, age discrimination), creators have more diverse needs based on their creative disciplines and business models. Distributed Creatives would need to identify the common threads that unite all creators while providing tailored benefits for different creative disciplines.

Overall, AARP demonstrates that building a large membership organization with significant advocacy power is achievable when the value proposition to individual members is clear and compelling.
