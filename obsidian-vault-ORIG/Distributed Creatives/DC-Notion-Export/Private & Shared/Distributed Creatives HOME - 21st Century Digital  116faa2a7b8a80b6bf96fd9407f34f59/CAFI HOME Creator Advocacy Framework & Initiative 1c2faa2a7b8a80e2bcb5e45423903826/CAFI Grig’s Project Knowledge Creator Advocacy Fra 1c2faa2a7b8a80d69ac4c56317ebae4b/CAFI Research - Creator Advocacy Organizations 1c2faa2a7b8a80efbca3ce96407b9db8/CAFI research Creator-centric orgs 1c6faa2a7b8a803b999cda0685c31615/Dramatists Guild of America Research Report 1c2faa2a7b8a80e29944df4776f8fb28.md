## Notes

The Dramatists Guild of America represents an excellent model of a long-standing advocacy organization focused on protecting intellectual property rights. Their emphasis on copyright ownership and creator control aligns strongly with Distributed Creatives' core values. The Guild's longevity (over 100 years) demonstrates the sustainability of an organization built around protecting creator rights.

While financial information is limited in public materials, the Guild appears to have established a sustainable model through membership dues, with special assessment structures for Broadway productions. This tiered approach could inform Distributed Creatives' revenue model.

The DG's advocacy work provides a strong template, though DC could differentiate by adding technological solutions and cross-disciplinary scope beyond theater writers. The Dramatists Guild's "Bill of Rights" concept could be adapted for DC's broader creator community.

The limited public information about membership numbers and financial details suggests an opportunity for DC to be more transparent in these areas to build trust with potential members.
