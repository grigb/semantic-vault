## Notes

Artists Rights Society represents an excellent case study for Distributed Creatives as it demonstrates the power of balancing practical services (licensing) with advocacy efforts. Their recent expansion into blockchain technology through ARSNL shows their adaptability and forward-thinking approach. The free membership model has allowed them to build a substantial base of 122,000+ artists, providing collective strength for advocacy while delivering tangible benefits through licensing revenue.

DC could benefit from studying ARS's transition into digital spaces while maintaining their core mission. However, DC has the opportunity to create a more comprehensive technological framework that spans all creative disciplines, provides better transparency, and integrates community-building more explicitly than ARS appears to do. The complementary positioning could allow for partnership rather than competition with specialist organizations like ARS.
