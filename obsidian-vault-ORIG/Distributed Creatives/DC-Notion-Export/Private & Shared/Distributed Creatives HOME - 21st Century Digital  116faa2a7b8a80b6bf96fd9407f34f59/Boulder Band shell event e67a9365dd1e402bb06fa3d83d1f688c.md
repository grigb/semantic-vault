- Use each event as an opportunity to nurture a tight-knit, engaged community around the Distributed Creatives brand.
- Encourage attendees to connect with artists on *Musely* for a seamless digital extension of the live experience.

### Phase 3: Expansion

- **Introduce Vendors**: Once attendance grows and operational stability is achieved, invite local artisans, food trucks, and small businesses to participate.
- **Enhance Programming**: Incorporate workshops, panel discussions, or collaborative art projects.
- **Scale Marketing**: Broaden the promotional reach with video content, paid ads, and artist spotlights.
