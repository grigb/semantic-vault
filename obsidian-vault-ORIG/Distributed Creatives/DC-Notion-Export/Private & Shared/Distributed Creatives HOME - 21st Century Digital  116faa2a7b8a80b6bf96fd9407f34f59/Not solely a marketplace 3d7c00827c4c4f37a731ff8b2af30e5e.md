# Not solely a marketplace

Iâ€™m really not a fan of the digital marketplaces. They feel really overwhelming with a huge wall of art that can be scrolled endlessly. Creates a really underwhelming experience as an art enthusiast. Way to much content for me to really take the time of each piece. Artists also have to create something flashy enough to capture that initial click in. 

I would rather see a feed of creative content that has rich media and the artists build resonance with the audience via their content. From there I go into their profile where I can purchase their works. 

How do we combat feed fatigue and engage in a more healthy relationship with the tech?
