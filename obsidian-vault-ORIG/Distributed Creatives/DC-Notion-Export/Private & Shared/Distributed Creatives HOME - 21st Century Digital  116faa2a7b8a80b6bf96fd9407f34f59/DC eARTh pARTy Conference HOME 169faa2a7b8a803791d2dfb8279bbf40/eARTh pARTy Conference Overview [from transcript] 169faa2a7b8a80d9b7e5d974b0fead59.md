## Overall Vision

The Earth Party Conference, styled as “eARTh pARTy,” is an event focused on building new systems and models for a better tomorrow, centered on art as the vehicle for transformation. The guiding ethos is a “voluntary art revolution”—bringing people together to share ideas, collaborate, and seed innovation for environmental, cultural, and social good. This conference is being planned by a nonprofit organization and aims to align with core principles such as regenerative thinking, distributed creative governance, and communal stewardship of resources.

From the initial discussion, the name “eARTh pARTy” is proposed with an emphasis on the capitalized “ART” in both “eARTh” and “pARTy.” The event will combine the elements of a think-tank style conference with workshops, art experiences, music, and opportunities for deep networking among passionate, forward-thinking communities.

## Purpose and Goals

1. **Raising Funds and Awareness**
    - The conference will be a fundraiser, potentially through crypto platforms such as [Giveth](https://giveth.io/) (and possibly others), to support future nonprofit activities.
    - Success on Giveth is crucial, as it will demonstrate the capacity to organize effective campaigns, potentially unlocking even more opportunities (e.g., Giveth’s planned “Curves” program for tokenizing public good projects).
2. **Showcasing Regenerative and Distributed Systems**
    - Participants will see firsthand how off-grid, sustainable living can be embraced through an immersive experience on a floating island venue (Forbes Island).
    - The conference aims to create a container where new technologies, especially decentralized crypto technologies and local governance models, are presented and discussed.
3. **Converging Art, Tech, Culture, and Ecology**
    - By hosting workshops and panels, the conference will highlight the intersection of art, environmental restoration, community building, and secure digital tools (e.g., the Internet Archive, local farming, Bloom Network’s distributed governance, etc.).
    - Attendees will participate in co-creative experiences, share knowledge, and form partnerships that spark ongoing projects for global benefit.
4. **Building a Supportive Community Network**
    - The intention is to gather “die-hard fans” and early adopters who wish to contribute to a thriving, regenerative future.
    - Key stakeholders from different backgrounds—such as large-scale event organizers, hackers, artists, technologists, farmers, and entrepreneurs—will be invited and encouraged to form new collaborations.

## Proposed Dates

### Target Window

In the conversation, multiple potential dates in late spring or summer were considered, balancing weather, attendee availability, and other major local events or festivals (e.g., ephemeral arts events, Burning Man, and other large gatherings). The prime candidate windows that emerged are:

- **Late May / Early June** – Possibly May 30 to June 1 (Friday-Sunday).
- **Mid-June** – However, the group is wary of overlapping with “Big Stick” (an art festival) or conflicting with Father’s Day or the Summer Solstice.
- **Late June** – June 27-29, though there is mention that some weekends here might be booked.
- **Early to Mid-July** – July 11-13 was discussed for better weather and avoiding direct conflict with ephemeral events at the end of July.

No single date has been locked in yet. The plan is to propose some of these weekends to key participants and finalize based on alignment with their schedules and the best chance for success.

## Venue: Forbes Island (Bradford Island, CA)

### Overview of the Location

- Forbes Island is a floating island venue located in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta area, near Bradford Island. This site is **off-grid**, featuring:
    - **No direct power lines** (electricity is run via generator and solar arrays on a boat called “Electric Avenue”).
    - **No city sewer** (the venue has its own system for pump-out or composting approaches, with a caretaker handling logistics).
    - **No city water** (drinking/cooking water is brought in via large refillable jugs).
    - A *lighthouse structure* on the island, multiple interior rooms, a tiki lounge, a large bar area with a fireplace, and beautifully crafted wood interiors.
    - Space for up to ~200 people if including the adjacent campground area on Bradford Island’s farmland (walking distance over the levee road).

### Interior Spaces on Forbes Island

- A gorgeous main bar and fireplace lounge with dark wood accents.
- Downstairs area that can seat anywhere from 40–60 people in one stretch, though some creative arrangement can accommodate more.
- The “Tiki Lounge” (upstairs) is a 20x40 or 20x30 space that can host smaller workshops or breakout sessions.
- Extra space on decks outside. Tents and tables can be rearranged for panels, presentations, and vendor/food setups.

### Outdoor Spaces and Surroundings

- **Crane Barge & Movie Barge:** Large floating barges that can be positioned for bigger keynote presentations or performances. The crane barge can move adjacent to the island for an “in-the-round” style of seating on surrounding docks.
- **Campground:** Across the levee on Bradford Island farmland, a ~5-acre flat space suitable for tents, plus potential future expansions for an “outdoor kitchen” and a small-scale regenerative farm demonstration.
- **Additional Docks:** Plenty of docking capacity for people’s boats, plus extra floating mini-golf barges and fun adult-playground elements (remnants from ephemera events).

### Lodging Options

- Camping on farmland across the levee.
- 60-ft Army boat (a “landing craft” or “Army boat”) with berths for those who don’t want to camp—these bunks can be rented.
- A small number of on-island bedrooms (including a master bedroom) for select speakers or staff.

### Power and Utilities

- **Generator & Solar** – Typically, if the event is in the middle of a sunny summer, solar power from “Electric Avenue” can handle much of the electricity until around 2 a.m. (especially for music or a DJ).
- **Water** – Large 5-gallon jugs that cost about $15 each, expecting to spend around $75–$100 for the weekend.
- **Septic** – A big part of the cost is pumping out the holding tanks (about $400–$800). If it’s a smaller group (~30 people), the cost may be on the lower end; large gatherings (~100+ people) may require more frequent pump-outs.

### Venue Fees, Staff, and Operational Costs

- Typical operational costs for a weekend event can range from **$1,200 to $1,900** or more depending on generator use, pump-outs, caretaker staffing, cleaning, etc.
    - *Generator fuel* can be about $500 for heavy usage if it’s a big DJ party.
    - *Caretaker fee* is ~$200/day (if caretaker presence is required).
    - *Cleaning fee* can be avoided if the organizers and final participants handle cleanup themselves; otherwise it’s ~$250–$300.
- The usual venue fee of $5,000 (to rent Forbes Island) is being waived for this event, as the owners are contributing it as one of their “free events” for the year. They do appreciate any donation back to help maintain the site.

## Transportation Logistics

### Bradford Island Ferry

- A small ferry that runs on a limited schedule, carrying cars (and passengers) across a short channel from the mainland to Bradford Island.
- The ride itself is only 5 minutes, but the ferry has defined departure times, sometimes only 9 a.m. to noon and then one at 3 p.m. or 5 p.m., etc.
- The group can pay extra to keep the ferry running beyond its last scheduled time (e.g., $150/hour).

### Driving Route

- If attendees choose to drive:
    1. Drive to the ferry landing on the mainland.
    2. Drive onto the ferry to cross over.
    3. Drive about a mile or so on the levee road to Forbes Island’s dock and campground area.

### Boat Shuttles (from Starboard Marina)

- Another option is to skip the ferry and use direct boat rides from a privately owned “Starboard Marina” (also owned by the caretaker team).
- The scenic ride takes 45–60 minutes at 5 mph through the Delta channels.
- A large Army boat can carry many people at once, or smaller boats can run multiple times.
- This approach provides more flexible departure times compared to the ferry schedule and is a fun “Delta experience.”
- Fees can be recouped by charging a modest fare to attendees who opt for the boat shuttle.

### Forms and Organization

- The owners have learned from experience to use sign-up forms where each ticket buyer picks their ferry or boat time slot in advance. This data populates a spreadsheet so organizers know exactly how many people to expect at each trip.

## Conference Format

### Duration

- A **Friday to Sunday** format is envisioned:
    - **Friday** – Attendee arrival, setup of camping, orientation, possibly an evening social or DJ set (but ending at a reasonable time so people are well-rested).
    - **Saturday** – Main conference day with workshops, panels, art installations, networking, and music at night.
    - **Sunday** – Farewell breakfast or short morning session, then breakdown and departures by ferry or boat (often around 11 a.m.–3 p.m.).

### Workshops and Panels

- The event is primarily about brainstorming systems for a better tomorrow, highlighting:
    1. **Art & Culture** – Possibly featuring interactive art, performance, or immersive experiences.
    2. **Tech & Crypto** – Presentations by Giveth, or other crypto platforms, plus Internet Archive connections (e.g., Brewster Kahle’s or affiliates’ involvement) and discussions about online archiving, digital security, and new “forever sites” projects.
    3. **Regenerative Agriculture** – Showcasing local farm produce from the area. The owners also plan to develop a “regen farm” and incorporate that into the demonstration (with a possible outdoor kitchen in 2024).
    4. **Bloom Network** – Another partner that organizes distributed local networks for regenerative living, possibly presenting their ongoing initiatives and local community building efforts.
    5. **Political Hope & Eco Restoration** – People like “Indy” (a podcaster focusing on bridging spiritual-eco activism, local restoration, and fundraising via crypto) may share their approach.

The hosting team wants to attract the “boldest and brightest” from Bay Area events, including contacts from the Culture Club (which comprises large-scale event organizers from underground or Burning Man-adjacent communities) to share best practices in event production, site regeneration, and more.

### Scheduling Suggestions

- Start sessions around 11:30 a.m. or noon on Saturday to accommodate late arrivals and the time needed for breakfast.
- Possibly run simultaneous workshops or panels so attendees can choose.
- Keynote or large group sessions could occur on the Crane Barge or a wide dock area, where many can gather.
- Smaller breakout workshops can happen inside the Tiki Lounge, bar area, or even on different floating docks.

## Ticketing and Budget Strategy

### Ticket Tiers

- The conversation suggests a sliding scale approach, for instance:
    - **Base Tier**: Around $200–$325 for the standard conference pass, covering basic costs (electricity, staff, cleanup, camping, etc.).
    - **Fundraiser Tier**: Around $500 or more, with an additional donation going toward the nonprofit’s mission.
- **Crowdfunding via Giveth**
    - The ticket “purchase” is actually a contribution on Giveth. Once contributed, donors would receive a link to forms to finalize their ferry or boat transportation details.
    - If people cannot afford the full ticket, they can use a lower tier or special cases. Alternatively, those with means might pay the higher tiers and help subsidize others.

### Attendance Goals

- Minimum target is ~30 attendees to ensure good energy and cover costs.
- Ideal range is 100–125, and the site can handle up to 150–200 if the farmland campground is fully utilized.
- The aim is to ensure traction—once a core group buys in, momentum is expected to build as word spreads.

### Costs Breakdown (Rough Estimate)

- **Base Venue Operating Costs**: $1,200–$1,900 (fuel, caretaker, water, cleaning, septic pump-out).
- **Staffing**:
    - Conference planning/production leads.
    - On-site caretaker or island manager.
    - Possible bartender or food service assistance.
    - Security or greeters for ferry/boat logistics.
- **Sound / Lighting**:
    - A wall of speakers and mixing boards are currently on-site; for a robust music setup, some additional gear might be needed, but generally the big pieces are already there.
- **Food**:
    - Attendees might bring their own or rely on a (or multiple) local food vendor(s), possibly paying a percentage to the event.
    - Minimizing single-use plastics and promoting local farm goods aligns with the event’s regenerative focus.

## Programming Ideas and Potential Speakers

The conversation revealed a list of potential participants and presentation topics:

1. **Internet Archive Connections**
    - Brewster Kahle (founder of the Internet Archive) or close collaborators could present on preserving knowledge, privacy, and building truly free digital archives.
    - Possible synergy with discussions on an “anarchist web” or curated digital knowledge spheres.
2. **Bloom Network**
    - Representatives (e.g., Magenta) who run localized nodes for regenerative community building. They can share success stories and open the door for others to join.
3. **Culture Club & Underground Organizers**
    - Seasoned large-scale event creators from the Bay Area (Burning Man communities, ephemeral arts gatherings). They bring valuable knowledge on event production, creativity, and community activation.
4. **Regenerative Agriculture**
    - Local farmers from the Delta region or the property owners’ own emerging acre(s) of farmland. Possibly integrated farm tours or sessions on local, resilient food systems.
5. **Crypto & Fundraising**
    - Giveth and other Ethereum-based donation platforms (e.g., Juicebox). Overviews of how tokenization can fund public goods, ensure transparency, and engage new communities.
6. **Political Hope & Eco Restoration**
    - “Indy” as a potential speaker, bridging the spiritual-art-eco synergy, discussing activism and direct action for ecological regeneration with crypto support.
7. **Solar / Off-Grid Tech**
    - Possibly featuring the floating solar array “Electric Avenue,” the caretaker’s approach to water, waste, and energy management. This is a real example of do-it-yourself off-grid solutions.
8. **Security & Governance**
    - Panel discussions on local decision-making, secure online communities, ownership, and new forms of nonprofit governance (“distributed creatives,” token-based stakeholder voting, etc.).

## Additional Notes from the Conversation

- **Music & Party Element**
While it’s called a “Conference,” there will be evening entertainment. DJs or local artists may perform. One group (e.g., Jobi and 11 of his DJ friends) has done so previously at Forbes Island.
- **Boat and Island Setup**
The venue has a crane barge, a “movie barge,” a tiki lounge, upper deck areas, and interior rooms. There could even be a scenario where the main keynote sessions happen with the speaker on the barge and participants seated all around on the docks.
- **Unusual, Rustic Experience**
The unpaved roads, ferry crossing, and the entire Delta environment create a sense of adventure. The aim is for attendees to embrace “rustic but meaningful” living for a weekend—where you might have to bring your own lantern or handle your own waste responsibly.
- **Pre-Event and Post-Event Labor**
Organizers plan to arrive early (possibly a week beforehand) for setup. Cleanup on Sunday will rely on volunteers or a hired service. The general spirit is: if you help, you keep costs low.
- **Collaboration with Local Drag Farming Collective**
The landowner’s partner is a drag queen and a landscape architect, creating an intersection of flamboyant creativity and farmland. This underscores the “outside-the-box” culture.
- **Ensuring Everyone’s Informed**
Clear instructions, forms, and orientation materials are crucial. Ferry times, boat departure schedules, a “how to get here” video, and direct phone lines for real-time arrivals will all be used to avoid confusion.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

- **Finalize Date**: Narrow down specific weekend options (possibly in May, June, or early July) by consulting with key potential speakers/partners and ensuring minimal overlap with existing major events (ephemera, Burning Man prep, etc.).
- **Launch Crowdfunding / Ticketing**: Set up the Giveth campaign with tiered pricing. Provide immediate follow-up forms for ferry/boat scheduling and updates.
- **Curate Speaker & Workshop Lineup**: Reach out to identified leaders (Culture Club, Internet Archive, Bloom Network, local farmers, etc.) to confirm interest, availability, and potential session topics.
- **Event Marketing**: Create a website or event page with all relevant info: location details, travel instructions, daily schedules, speaker bios, and philosophical background (“Why Earth Party Conference?”).
- **Logistics & Infrastructure**: Confirm the caretaker plan, generator/fuel needs, cleaning schedule, and possible bartending / food-vendor deals. Ensure a sustainable approach (e.g., minimal plastic, local farm produce).

Above all, the Earth Party Conference aims to unite visionary individuals eager to design a future grounded in art, community, regenerative agriculture, secure tech, and truly “off-grid” solutions. The novelty and transformational potential of hosting this event at a floating off-grid island will be a powerful draw—fostering a space for collaboration, discussion, and celebration that participants will remember and carry forward into impactful, long-term projects.

# Additional information

1. **Waiver of the Usual $5,000 Venue Fee**
    - The owners are granting use of Forbes Island at no charge (one of their free annual events), but they hope for a donation back to help maintain the property.
    - This waiver helps keep event costs down compared to the normal $5k rental.
2. **Detailed Operations Budget / Costs**
    - The conversation went into specifics about typical weekend expenses (e.g., septic pump-outs at $400–$800, generator fuel of about $500, caretaker wages of $200/day, optional cleaning fees of $250–$300 if not handled by volunteers, etc.).
    - None of these operational cost details are mentioned in the summary.
3. **Caretaker Role and Staffing**
    - A caretaker (and/or point person) is needed to manage power, septic, docking logistics, etc. Sometimes the organizer (or someone local) can substitute, but that reduces caretaker fees.
    - This facet was not noted in the overview.
4. **Ferry Extension Costs**
    - After-hours ferry runs can be arranged at about $150 per hour for those arriving or departing later than the ferry’s normal schedule.
    - This is important for attendee logistics and budgeting but is missing from the overview.
5. **Crane Barge / Movie Barge**
    - There are two large barges moored alongside Forbes Island (one with a crane, another dubbed the “movie barge”). These can be moved in front of Forbes Island to serve as performance or keynote stages.
    - The overview references “multiple deck spaces” but does not mention these barges, which were a key highlight of the conversation.
6. **Army Boat with Sleeping Berths**
    - Besides camping and on-island bedrooms, a 60-ft Army boat is often moored at Forbes Island; it can be rented out for bunk-style accommodations.
    - The summary references camping but omits this extra lodging option.
7. **Mini-Golf Barge and Other Floating Platforms**
    - A mini-golf barge and additional floating docks exist, potentially used for smaller breakout sessions or fun side activities.
    - Not in the overview.
8. **Use of Online Forms for Ferry/Boat Logistics**
    - From past events, the organizers found it crucial to have an online form where each ticket-holder chooses a ferry or boat time slot. That helps track who’s arriving when and avoids ferry bottlenecks.
    - The current overview just mentions “transportation options” but not the planned sign-up form process.
9. **Bartending / Bar Approach**
    - The conversation covered possibly having a simple, themed bar with a small menu of premixed drinks, donation-based cocktails, or hiring a local bartender.
    - While “Evening bar with specialty themed drinks” is in the overview, the original discussion stressed that the bar might be volunteer- or staff-run, with certain cost or donation implications.
10. **Extra Weekend Setup Time**
    - The plan mentioned that organizers may arrive earlier (sometimes up to a week) to prepare the site, test power, arrange spaces, etc.
    - Not specified in the summary.
11. **Mention of Big Stick, Ephemerisle, and Other Nearby Events**
    - In conversation, it was noted that scheduling must work around other summer events (Big Stick, ephemeral gatherings, Burning Man build season, etc.).
    - The overview alludes to “proposed dates” but not the context of coordinating around these local/regional festivals or communities.
12. **Potential for Additional Local Food Sourcing**
    - The group discussed possibly sourcing food locally (e.g., produce from nearby farms) to emphasize regenerative agriculture.
    - “Food trucks on-site” is mentioned but not the local farm-to-table concept or the possibility of on-site meal preparation as part of the “outdoor kitchen” approach.
