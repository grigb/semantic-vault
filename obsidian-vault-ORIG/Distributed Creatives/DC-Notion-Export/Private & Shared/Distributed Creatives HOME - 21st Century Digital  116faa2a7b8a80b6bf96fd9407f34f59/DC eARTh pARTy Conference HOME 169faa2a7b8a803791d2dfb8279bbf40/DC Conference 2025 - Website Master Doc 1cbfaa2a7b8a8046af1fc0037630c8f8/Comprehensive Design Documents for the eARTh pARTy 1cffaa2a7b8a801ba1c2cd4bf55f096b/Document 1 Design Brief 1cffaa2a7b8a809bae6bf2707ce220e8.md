# Document 1: Design Brief

**Title:** Design Brief for eARTh pARTy Conference Website

**Purpose:** To provide a high-level overview of the website’s goals, audience, and design requirements for the AI to create a React-based landing page.

**Overview:**

The eARTh pARTy Conference, organized by Distributed Creatives, is a transformative gathering focused on decentralized, regenerative creative economies. The website must reflect this innovative spirit through a modern, clean design featuring an evolving constellation of multicolor dots that symbolizes the conference’s theme of distributed yet connected creativity. The landing page will include 12 sections (Header, Hero, About, Program, Speakers, Venue, Transportation, Registration, What to Bring, FAQs, Contact, Footer) and must be sparse in content layout to accommodate the constellation effect, which will take up significant visual space.

**Target Audience:**

- Visionary technologists, artists, and cultural leaders.
- Individuals interested in art, technology, sustainability, and decentralized systems.
- Attendees seeking a unique, immersive conference experience.

**Design Goals:**

1. **Visual Narrative:** Use an evolving constellation of multicolor dots (blue: #00A3E0, green: #34C759, yellow: #FF9500, red: #FF3B30) to represent the distributed nature of the conference. The constellation will take up a fixed space (top-right 30% of the viewport) and change shape as users scroll, reflecting each section’s content.
2. **Sparse Layout:** Keep content minimal and centered/left-aligned to leave room for the constellation effect, ensuring a clean, uncluttered design.
3. **Interactivity:** The constellation animates on scroll, with dots growing (max 12px radius), shrinking, and connecting to form shapes (e.g., a disco ball, lighthouse).
4. **Modern Aesthetic:** Use a white background (#FFFFFF), dark gray text (#1A1A1A), and vibrant dot accents, with a focus on simplicity and readability.

**Key Features:**

- **Constellation Effect:** A fixed canvas in the top-right 30% of the viewport (300px x 300px on desktop, scaled proportionally on mobile) where 15-20 multicolor dots animate to form section-specific shapes.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully responsive for all devices, with simplified animations on mobile.
- **Typography:** Montserrat Bold for headings, Open Sans Regular for body text, Pacifico for accents (e.g., buttons, taglines).

**Deliverables:**

- A React-based landing page with all 12 sections.
- Interactive constellation effect integrated into the design.
- Responsive layout with sparse content to accommodate the constellation.
- Basic SEO meta tags using react-helmet.
