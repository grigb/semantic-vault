# Technical Summary

## **1. PIR Motion Sensors (Foot Traffic - Basic)**

### **Concept**

Passive Infrared (PIR) motion sensors detect body heat when a person moves in front of the display. These sensors are simple and effective for **estimating foot traffic**, but they **do not count individual people** or track viewing time.

### **How It Works**

- Detects motion within a **5-10 foot range**.
- Only registers presence when movement occurs.
- Cannot differentiate between individuals or track dwell time.

### **Best For**

- **Low-budget tracking** in areas where **exact numbers are not required**.
- Estimating **relative** foot traffic trends.

üí∞ **Cost Per Display: $10**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:** No detailed data, only detects movement.

---

## **2. Wi-Fi Probe Request Scanner (Foot Traffic - Basic to Moderate)**

### **Concept**

Every Wi-Fi-enabled device (smartphone, tablet, laptop) constantly **sends out signals** looking for networks. A **Wi-Fi probe request scanner** detects these signals, estimating how many people are near the display.

### **How It Works**

- Detects **Wi-Fi-enabled devices** within range (~30-50 feet).
- **No app or login required**‚Äîworks passively.
- Cannot differentiate **individuals** but provides a **rough count**.

### **Best For**

- **Businesses tracking engagement trends** without using cameras.
- Estimating traffic **patterns over time**.

üí∞ **Cost Per Display: Free (if using an existing router) or $100**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:** Only detects people with Wi-Fi-enabled devices.

---

## **3. Infrared Beam Break Sensors (Foot Traffic - Basic Counting)**

### **Concept**

An **infrared beam** is placed across an entryway or in front of a display. When someone **walks past and breaks the beam**, it **counts one person**. If two sensors are placed side by side, they can **determine the direction** of movement.

### **How It Works**

- Simple **"entry/exit" count** method.
- Can be used **indoors or outdoors**.
- **Dual-sensor setup** allows **directional tracking**.

### **Best For**

- **Narrow walkways** where people must pass through a specific area.
- Small spaces with **controlled access points**.

üí∞ **Cost Per Display: $25 - $50**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:** Cannot track dwell time or differentiate individuals.

---

## **4. AI USB Camera + Raspberry Pi (Foot Traffic - Mid-Level AI Counting)**

### **Concept**

A **USB camera connected to a Raspberry Pi** runs **AI software** that can detect and count people. Open-source tools like **OpenCV** analyze video feeds in real-time, providing **more accurate audience measurement**.

### **How It Works**

- Uses **computer vision** to detect people in real-time.
- Can estimate **dwell time** and **engagement**.
- Does not store personal data or facial features.

### **Best For**

- **Moderate-budget tracking** that balances **cost and accuracy**.
- **Indoor and outdoor installations** where cameras are allowed.

üí∞ **Cost Per Display: $100**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:** Requires **occasional recalibration** for best results.

---

## **5. Used Security Camera + OpenCV AI Vehicle Detection (Outdoor Vehicle Tracking - Mid-Level)**

### **Concept**

A **repurposed security camera** combined with **OpenCV AI software** can **count vehicles** passing an outdoor display. AI-powered object detection can even estimate **vehicle types (cars, trucks, motorcycles).**

### **How It Works**

- Camera records **video feed**, AI detects **vehicles**.
- Can track **speed, direction, and volume** of traffic.
- Works best in **consistent lighting conditions**.

### **Best For**

- **Outdoor digital billboards** needing vehicle impression data.
- Situations where city traffic data **is not available**.

üí∞ **Cost Per Display: $150**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:** Needs **periodic AI model updates**.

---

## **6. DIY Radar Sensor (Outdoor Vehicle Tracking - Mid-Level)**

### **Concept**

A **low-cost radar sensor** detects **motion and speed** of passing vehicles. This method provides a **simple way to estimate traffic volume**, even in **low-light conditions**.

### **How It Works**

- Radar detects **metal objects moving at speed**.
- Estimates **vehicle counts and speeds**.
- Works **day and night**, unlike cameras.

### **Best For**

- **Roadside displays** where counting cars is the main goal.
- Areas with **low visibility** where cameras are ineffective.

üí∞ **Cost Per Display: $150**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:** Does not differentiate **vehicle types**.

---

## **7. Commercial AI Camera with Facial Recognition & Heat Mapping (Foot Traffic - High Accuracy)**

### **Concept**

A **high-end commercial AI camera** can detect **precise audience engagement** using **heat maps** and **anonymous facial recognition**. This provides **highly detailed analytics**.

### **How It Works**

- Recognizes **how long someone looks at a display**.
- Tracks **engagement by age, gender, and mood** (anonymized).
- Heat maps show **which parts of a display are most viewed**.

### **Best For**

- **High-traffic locations** needing detailed audience analytics.
- Advertisers looking for **precise engagement data**.

üí∞ **Cost Per Display: $500**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:** High cost, may have **privacy concerns** in public areas.

---

## **8. Professional AI Traffic Camera (Outdoor Vehicle Tracking - High Accuracy)**

### **Concept**

A **commercial-grade AI traffic camera** can **identify vehicle types, count cars, and even track license plates** (if needed for private parking analytics). This is the **most accurate** way to count passing vehicles.

### **How It Works**

- Uses **machine learning** to detect **car types and counts**.
- Works **in all lighting conditions**.
- Can provide **live data feeds** to cloud analytics.

### **Best For**

- **Billboards on high-traffic streets** needing accurate impressions.
- Advertisers tracking **ROI on digital ads**.

üí∞ **Cost Per Display: $1,000**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations:** High cost, requires **internet connection for cloud analytics**.
