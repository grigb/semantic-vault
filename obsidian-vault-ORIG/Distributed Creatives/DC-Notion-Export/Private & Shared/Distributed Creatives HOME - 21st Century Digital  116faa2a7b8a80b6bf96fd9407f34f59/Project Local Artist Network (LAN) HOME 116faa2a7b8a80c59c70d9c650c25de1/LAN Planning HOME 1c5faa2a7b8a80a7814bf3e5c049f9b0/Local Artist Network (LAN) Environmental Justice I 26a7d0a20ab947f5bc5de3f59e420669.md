# Local Artist Network (LAN) Environmental Justice Integration Proposal

# Digital Lifelines: Community Alerts and Education Through the Local Artist Network

## Project Overview

The Local Artist Network (LAN) platform will be enhanced to support environmental justice initiatives through an expansive digital network that reaches homes, hotels, retail spaces, and public venues via smart TVs and digital displays. This infrastructure enables community resource visualization and disaster preparedness tools, delivering critical information through an intuitive menu system that integrates local alerts, news, and public broadcasts.

## Digital Network Infrastructure

The LAN system delivers content through:

- Smart TV applications for residential viewing
- Hotel information systems integration
- Retail location displays with customizable content
- Public space installations with interactive features
- City-wide digital signage network showing impressions

## Community Resource Visualization

The LAN digital signage network and community platform will be expanded to include:

- Interactive maps showing environmental hazards, resources, and community assets
- Real-time air and water quality monitoring displays
- Food security and local agriculture connection points
- Energy efficiency program availability and adoption rates
- Waste reduction and recycling facility locations

## Disaster Preparedness Integration

LAN's existing digital infrastructure will be leveraged to:

- Display real-time emergency alerts and updates across all connected devices
- Coordinate community response efforts through the menu system
- Share evacuation routes and safe gathering points
- Connect vulnerable populations with assistance
- Track and distribute emergency resources

## Technical Implementation

The following components will be developed:

- Data visualization dashboard using the existing LAN display network
- Smart TV and digital display applications with intuitive menu interface
- Mobile-responsive web application for community access
- API integration with environmental monitoring systems
- Secure database for resource tracking and distribution
- Emergency communication system integrated with existing LAN infrastructure

## Community Engagement Strategy

Implementation will follow LAN's established community-first approach:

- Partner with local environmental justice organizations for needs assessment
- Train community ambassadors in system usage and maintenance
- Host regular feedback sessions and user testing
- Develop educational content for digital displays
- Create multilingual interfaces and materials

## Expected Outcomes

Within the two-year project period:

- Deploy resource visualization tools across all target zip codes
- Train community ambassadors to manage alerts and content
- Establish disaster preparedness protocols in all participating communities
- Create baseline environmental quality metrics for future comparison
- Document best practices for system replication in other communities

## Budget Allocation

**Tier II Development: 2-year project, up to $50,000**

- Technical development, implementation, testing, integration: $35,000
- Community engagement and training: $5,000
- Program management and evaluation: $9,700
- Hardware and infrastructure: $300 per installation

## Sustainability Plan

Long-term sustainability will be achieved through:

- Integration with existing LAN infrastructure and maintenance processes
- Training of local community members for system management
- Partnership with environmental organizations for ongoing support
- Documentation and open-source code sharing for system replication
- Development of funding mechanisms for continued operation
