# Project: LAN - Local Artists Network - v1

## Short Description

The LAN is a digital infrastructure that overlay’s independent art economies at the city scale. They are designed to function in small towns to large cities and interconnect the nodes via the digital infrastructure to create a global lattice of thriving distributed art economies. Our mission is to empower the creative industries to become a top 10 global industry while keeping the power in the hands of the creatives and local communities. 

The LAN works by being the thread which weaves together the artists, art related businesses and art enthusiasts at the community level. This enables the community to be highly engaged with each other driving participation in the creative scene thus driving commerce and opportunity for creatives to establish a working career. By focusing on the local communities it creates a small enough field of participation that creatives can get their work in front of an audience, without having to fight in competition against billions of other users and bots, generating endless content to satisfy a platform, which makes it’s profits from users being chronically online and siloed in their platform. 

**List of types of events**

Performances, concerts, film screenings, art exhibitions, workshops, literary events, fashion shows, metaverse experiences, open mic nights, pop-up events, photography exhibits, collaborative art jams, multimedia experiences, cultural and heritage shows, interactive performances, panel discussions, gaming events, street performances, and festivals.
