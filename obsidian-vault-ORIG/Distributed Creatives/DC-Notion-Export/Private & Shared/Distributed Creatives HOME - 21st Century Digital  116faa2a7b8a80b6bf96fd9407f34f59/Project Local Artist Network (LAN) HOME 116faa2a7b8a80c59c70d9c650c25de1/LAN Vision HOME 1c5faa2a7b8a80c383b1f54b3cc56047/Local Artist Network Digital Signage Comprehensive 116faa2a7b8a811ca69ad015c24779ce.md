# Local Artist Network Digital Signage Comprehensive Vision

## Distributed Creatives: A Digital Signage Vision

**Project Overview**

Distributed Creatives' digital signage project aims to revolutionize how art, culture, and community intersect. By strategically placing high-end video screens in multiple venues across the community, we'll create a dynamic, interconnected network streaming a vibrant mix of multi-medium art, advertising, event promotion, and live performances.

**Phase One: Prototype**

Our initial phase focuses on establishing a robust foundation for the network. Key components include:

- **Curated Content**: We'll showcase a captivating selection of NFT art, TikTok-style videos with text overlays, poetry visualized as video, and works from renowned artists like Dank Phart, Z Bass, Maggie Saunders, Lilly Fangz, and Randal Roberts. We'll also feature local Boulder poets, fine artists with physical art for sale, and global NFT collections.
- **Display Site/Venue Requirements**: Each location will need a street-facing window with space for a 55‚Äù flatscreen and mounting solution, a high-speed internet connection, and an Apple TV or PC. Optional live performance capabilities will further enhance the network's offerings.
- **Technical Infrastructure**: We'll establish a LAN digital signage infrastructure to ensure seamless content delivery and network management.

**Vision Statement**

Imagine a vibrant tapestry of art and culture woven through the heart of our community. As the day unfolds, audiences can journey from one venue to the next, experiencing a continuous stream of captivating content. Even those who stay put won't miss out, as the stream persists, creating a sense of shared experience and connection.

Our variety talk show will serve as a central hub, spotlighting artists and their projects. The goal is to foster a sense of synergy between venues, strengthen social cohesion within the creative community, and attract paying customers to participating locations.

As Distributed Creatives expands to other cities, each locale will develop its own unique broadcast. Audiences will be empowered to choose content from any city in the network, further fostering a sense of global creative community.

**Comprehensive Vision**

Distributed Creatives' digital signage project represents a bold step towards a more connected, vibrant, and inclusive creative landscape. By leveraging technology and fostering collaboration, we aim to:

- **Amplify artistic voices**: Provide a platform for artists across various mediums to showcase their work to a wider audience.
- **Stimulate economic growth**: Drive foot traffic and revenue to participating venues, supporting the local creative economy.
- **Cultivate community**: Foster social cohesion and a sense of shared purpose among artists, audiences, and venues.
- **Inspire and educate**: Offer a continuous source of artistic inspiration and cultural enrichment for the community.

Together, let's create a future where art, culture, and community thrive in a dynamic, interconnected network.
