    **The Essence of Creativity: A Journey Through Humanity and Beyond**
    
    Creativity is a multifaceted concept that resonates differently with each individual. To some, it's an artistic endeavor; to others, it's an essential survival mechanism. Yet, perhaps the most profound understanding is that creativity is an intrinsic part of the human experience—a continuous expression of the soul that permeates every aspect of our lives, even in our dreams.
    
    **Creativity as a Universal Experience**
    
    The human mind is perpetually engaged in creative processes. Even when we're not consciously thinking, our dreams weave narratives that reflect our deepest thoughts and emotions. This incessant creativity suggests that it's hardwired into our very being. But humans are not the sole proprietors of creativity. In the animal kingdom, we observe primates using tools, birds crafting intricate nests, and marine creatures exhibiting complex behaviors. These examples hint at creativity being a vital component of survival across species. On a genetic level, evolution itself can be seen as a grand creative process, continuously adapting and reshaping life.
    
    **The Ubiquity of Human Creativity**
    
    In our daily lives, creativity manifests in myriad ways. We concoct meals, forge relationships, devise plans, and, of course, create art. The sciences—both natural and digital—are extensions of our creative pursuit to understand and manipulate the world around us. They are as crucial to our evolution as the most celebrated works of art. Every action, thought, and innovation stems from a wellspring of creativity that defines our humanity.
    
    **Defining Art in an Infinite Spectrum**
    
    Art defies singular definition. It transcends mediums, genres, and forms, encompassing everything from the tangible to the ephemeral. We express ourselves through voice, rhythm, words, movement, emotions, and even unarticulated thoughts. The "mind's eye" envisions possibilities yet to materialize, embodying the purest form of creativity—the ideas that linger just beyond conscious grasp.
    
    **A Personal Odyssey Through Creativity**
    
    As someone who has navigated the realms of music, writing, art, and entrepreneurship, I've continually explored the fundamental reasons behind our innate drive to create. This journey has led me through various philosophies, religions, and mental states, each enriching my perception of the world and deepening my emotional experiences.
    
    In striving to master my crafts, I transitioned from a passive consumer of ideas to an active participant in the creative process. This shift allowed me to appreciate the intricacies and labor behind others' works, enhancing my overall experience of art and innovation.
    
    **The Deepening Appreciation with Age**
    
    With time and (hopefully) wisdom, my sensitivity to the nuances of creative expression has intensified. I'm often moved to tears by manifestations of the human soul—be it a masterpiece in a museum, the collective effort behind an epic film, or a particular sequence of musical notes that consistently resonates with me. Understanding the dedication and passion infused in these creations amplifies their impact.
    
    **Challenging Modern Constraints on Creativity**
    
    Today's society often attempts to dictate the boundaries of creative experiences, but true creativity knows no limits. Throughout my life, I've witnessed the fluctuating fortunes of creative individuals. There was a time when artisans held esteemed positions in society. The advent of recorded music opened new horizons for artists, yet the current landscape sees even the most popular musicians earning a fraction of what was once possible, despite massive listenership.
    
    **A Mission to Empower Creatives**
    
    This shift has fueled my lifelong mission to alter the narrative. Beginning as a classical violinist, venturing into jazz piano, and founding a psychedelic rock band that thrived for over two decades, I've immersed myself in various creative communities. My journey took me to the vibrant San Francisco Bay Area, where I managed a sound system, ran a music label, operated a digital download store, performed electronic music, and produced for my band before returning to Boulder, Colorado.
    
    Throughout these experiences, I've connected with remarkable creators worldwide—superstar DJs, visionary fine artists, and undiscovered talents performing in festivals, on street corners, and online platforms. Despite their diverse backgrounds, a common thread unites them: the need to live sustainably, gain recognition, and engage with the world meaningfully.
    
    **Harnessing Technology and Community for Creative Sustainability**
    
    As a founder of Distributed Creatives, my mission is to empower creators to focus on their passions while earning a livelihood. I believe technology can play a pivotal role in this endeavor by providing platforms that democratize access to resources, audiences, and collaborative opportunities. Moreover, fostering strong communities can amplify support systems, enabling creatives to thrive without compromising their artistic integrity.
    
    **Envisioning the Future of Creativity and Humanity**
    
    Looking ahead, the trajectory of creativity is increasingly intertwined with the future of humanity. As artificial intelligence and automation alleviate the burdens of menial tasks, we inch closer to a society where traditional notions of work, money, and property may evolve or even become obsolete. In such a world, our true currency will be creativity and the quality of our interactions within communities.
    
    Our capacity for creative expression and connection will define our roles in this new paradigm. It's an opportunity to rediscover and prioritize what fundamentally makes us human—the ability to imagine, create, and share experiences that transcend the mundane.

    In embracing this future, we honor the timeless essence of creativity that has always been and will continue to be the heartbeat of human existence.

    Creativity means many things to many people. It could be said that the mind is always in a creative experience, even when dreaming. Creativity feels like an expression of the soul and some thing we are hardwired to do all the time. As humans, we are not alone in the creative experience. If you look at the Animal Kingdom, you will see the use of tooling amongst primates and birds and others on land, in the skies, and in the oceans. Perhaps creativity is actually necessary for a survival. Perhaps at a genetic level the evolution of the species is a creative process.
    
    Looking at humans, I would say that almost everything we do is creative whether it's creating food, creating connections, creating a plan for the day, and of course, creating art. The discovery of the natural world through science, and the sciences we have invented to define our digital domain, are just as important to the evolution of our species as the art that we produce.
    
    What is art? Certainly not a single form. Multimedia, or no medium at all, and everything in between. Any genre or no genre. We use the voice, drumming, the written word, the spoken word, dance, emotion, and certainly the most deep of all is the un-expressed thoughts in our minds. The mind eye, the ephemeral unknown, the thought that has yet to emerge.
    
    As a musician, writer, artist, entrepreneur for my entire life, I have had many opportunities to understand and ask questions about the fundamental reason for being creative. It has led me to look through the worlds, philosophies and religions and states of mind and it has helped me and rich, the way I see the world and feel my emotions.
    
    In my explorations of understanding myself, I have come to appreciate the creations of others even more. I think it starts with the first thing you want to try to master. He start to look at what others have done, and you go from a passive consumer of ideas to, truly understanding the process behind them. This enriches, the experience of appreciating what others have made and presented to the world.
    
    As I have grown older, and hopefully wiser, my appreciation for the finer details has only grown stronger. I find myself brought to tears by the true expression of the human soul. Whether it's fine art in a museum, or an epic movie with thousands of people working on it, or, the intervals in a piece of music that move me every time I hear it, my soul is touched in a way that nothing else really can.
    
    Part of that appreciation is understanding the process and love that goes into the creative works around me.
    
    Our modern world has decided for itself what creative experiences should be, but there is no limit.
    
    In my limited life on this planet, I have seen the promise of success for the creatives come and go. At one point in the past, the artisan were considered some of the highest positions in society. As music became a recorded, medium, worlds of possibilities became available to musicians. As we know things have changed since then and even the most highly regarded musicians who are listen to billions of times a year are only making a fraction of what was once possible.
    
    I am on a lifelong mission to change that.
    
    I started off as a classical violinist, and in high school began studying jazz piano and in my senior year founded a psychedelic rock band that played together for over 20 years. We moved to the San Francisco area, where I ran a sound system, a music label, a digital download store, performed my solo, electronic music, wrote and produced music for the band, and eventually, after 20 years in the Bay Area, found myself moving to Boulder, Colorado again.
    
    I have worked with and met incredible creators all over the world. Many of whom you've heard of before. From superstar DJs, an visionary painters creating “high art”, to unknown creative talent at festivals, street corners, and online. everyone I speak to seems to have the same needs. They need to be able to live, be discovered, and be part of the world around them.
    
    As a founder at Distributed Creatives, my mission is to enable creators to stay on their path, focusing on what they love while making a living doing it. Technology, I believe is one of the many ways that we can enable this process. Community, is a strong partner in this as well.
    
    The future of creativity is shaping up to be the future of humanity. As AI takes over all of the remedial work tasks and we move towards a world without money or property the real currency will become our creative expression and community interactions.
