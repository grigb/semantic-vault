# Fiscal Sponsorship Overview

## How does it work?

A project/organization identifies another nonprofit (one that is 
already tax-exempt and generally has a similar mission) to agree to 
serve as its fiscal sponsor, which means that it is agreeing to accept 
the administrative and fiduciary responsibilities of receiving 
charitable gifts on behalf of the sponsored project/organization.

- The fiscal sponsor must first determine that serving as a fiscal sponsor is consistent with its mission (and does not [jeopardize its own tax-exempt status](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/governance-leadership/protect-your-nonprofits-tax-exempt-status)).
- Donations are made *to the fiscal sponsor,* not to the
sponsored program/organization directly. Since the fiscal sponsor is
tax-exempt, the donor’s contribution will qualify as a deductible
contribution.
- The fiscal sponsor then makes a "grant" to the sponsored project/organization.
- The fiscal sponsor is responsible for sending donors [gift acknowledgements](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/fundraising-and-resource-development/gift-acknowledgments-saying-thank-you-donors) and for reporting the income and expenditures in its own financial records
(such as the IRS Form 990). The sponsor is also responsible for serving
as a fiduciary for the contributions made to benefit the sponsored
program, so honoring restrictions placed on the gifts by donors, and
making prudent decisions about financial management and internal
controls in connection with funds received, are all the responsibility
of the sponsor.
- The sponsored project/organization is responsible for whatever
recordkeeping and reports it agrees to provide to its sponsor and
anything else that is documented as its responsibilities in any written
agreement it has with the sponsor, or if the sponsored project is a
corporate entity, any [legal filing obligations it may be responsible for under state law](https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/running-nonprofit/administration-and-financial-management/annual-filing-requirements-nonprofits).

## What does a fiscal sponsor do?

The role of the fiscal sponsor can include performing many different 
administrative functions on behalf of the sponsored organization or 
program, including taking on the responsibility of receiving and 
administering charitable contributions on behalf of the sponsored 
organization. Some fiscal sponsors do a lot more, such as performing 
back-office functions.

It is quite common and perfectly acceptable for the fiscal sponsor to
 charge an administrative fee for its services, which is usually a 
percentage of the budget of the sponsored organization or program. Using
 a fiscal sponsor satisfies IRS requirements as long as the fiscal 
sponsor maintains the right to decide, at its own discretion, how it 
will use contributions. Maintaining control over the donated funds is a 
requirement of a legitimate fiscal sponsor arrangement.

## Why choose fiscal sponsorship?

Fiscal sponsorship is often used by newly formed nonprofits that need
 to raise money during the start-up phase, before they are recognized as
 tax-exempt by the IRS. Using a fiscal sponsor enables a program or 
organization that does not *itself* qualify as tax-exempt to 
attract funding for its operations that will -- through the fiscal 
sponsor - be tax-deductible to donors. Therefore fiscal sponsor 
arrangements benefit organizations or programs that are not tax-exempt 
by providing a flow-through pathway for revenue that the organization 
may not otherwise be in a position to receive.

- Donors are not able to claim a tax deduction unless they itemize
deductions and donate to an organization that is recognized by the IRS
as tax-exempt pursuant to IRS Code Section 501(c)(3). See IRS [Publication 557.](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p557.pdf)
- Additionally, the guidelines of most private foundations explicitly
require grantees to be recognized as tax-exempt by the IRS.
Consequently, groups that are not formally recognized by the IRS as
tax-exempt are generally not eligible for grants from private
foundations.

Other reasons:

- Fiscal sponsorship might be chosen by a newly formed nonprofit that
seeks to test-drive its ideas to determine whether there is a market or a desire among the public to fund the end product.
- Some organizations/programs remain in a fiscal sponsorship
relationship for a long time, deciding that their mission can be
achieved in that structure without creating a new entity.
- Some organizations - including those that are tax-exempt - find that utilizing a fiscal sponsor to outsource administrative
responsibilities, whether back-office tasks, or those relating to
fundraising and disbursement of funds, is the right business model for
them. This structure might be particularly well-suited for all-volunteer organizations.
- In its 2021 report, "[Reimagining Fiscal Sponsorship in Service of Equity](https://www.tsne.org/reimagining-fiscal-sponsorship-report)," TSNE explored how fiscal sponsors can provide holistic, responsive, and culturally aligned fiscal management for under-resourced, BIPOC-led
grassroots groups working to support marginalized communities.

## Practice Pointers

It's best to outline the responsibilities and obligations of both parties in a **written agreement** between the fiscal sponsor and the sponsored organization. The agreement should specify that the fiscal sponsor is 
responsible for all legal compliance relating to receiving, reporting, 
and acknowledging charitable donations. The agreement should also 
describe the administrative fee that the sponsored organization will 
provide to its fiscal sponsor, as well as any record keeping 
responsibilities that the sponsored organization owes the fiscal 
sponsor.
