# Symphony AI: A Full-Spectrum Creative Platform

## Vision
A platform that enables creators (writers, musicians, developers, designers, entrepreneurs) to:
- Compose music collaboratively (AI-assisted)
- Write and publish books and articles
- Architect and launch apps (iOS, desktop, metaverse)
- Visualize knowledge graphs of their creative process
- Manage projects, tasks, and ideas seamlessly

## Key Features
- **AI Composer**: Generates musical motifs, harmonies, and arrangements.
- **Book Builder**: Outlines, drafts, and edits chapters with LLM assistance.
- **App Architect**: Visual drag-and-drop for multi-platform app design (iOS, desktop, VR/metaverse).
- **Knowledge Graph**: Visualizes relationships between ideas, projects, collaborators, and resources.
- **Entrepreneur Dashboard**: Tracks business models, pitches, and progress.

## Related Ideas
- Integrate with Notion, Obsidian, and GitHub for seamless data flow.
- Use Qdrant for semantic search across all creative assets.
- Deploy AnythingLLM for querying project knowledge.
- Enable decentralized sync for privacy and collaboration.

## Example Tasks
- [ ] Draft Chapter 1: "The AI Musician"
- [ ] Design UI for iOS app prototype
- [ ] Compose theme for demo video
- [ ] Map knowledge graph of all project ideas
- [ ] Prepare investor pitch deck

## Notes
- Inspiration: "The intersection of art, code, and entrepreneurship."
- Potential collaborators: Alice (designer), Bob (musician), Carol (developer)
- Target platforms: iOS, macOS, Windows, Meta Quest, Web
