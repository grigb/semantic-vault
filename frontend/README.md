# Semantic Vault Frontend

A modern React UI for uploading Markdown files and searching your knowledge graph.

## Features
- Drag-and-drop Markdown upload
- Search bar with live results
- Responsive Material UI design

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```
3. The app will be available at http://localhost:3000

## Configuration
- The React app expects the backend API (`/episode`, `/search`) to be available at the same host. Use a proxy or adjust API URLs if needed.
