# Semantic Vault: Project State and Handoff Documentation

## Current State (as of 2025-04-25)

### What’s Working
- Python dependencies installed in `.venv` virtual environment.
- Docker Compose stack launches and runs `neo4j`, `graphiti`, `anythingllm`, and `qdrant` containers successfully.
- Ingestion and test scripts are present and ready to run.
- The README is up-to-date and comprehensive.

### Current Blocker
- **Embedding proxy service** (required for `/v1/embeddings` on port 9009) is **NOT running**.
    - This service is essential for generating vector embeddings during ingestion and search.
    - Ingestion/test scripts fail because they cannot connect to this endpoint.
- Docker Compose file does **not** currently include a service for the embedding proxy.

### What Needs to Happen Next
- Update `docker/docker-compose.yml` to add an embedding proxy service (e.g., Ollama OpenAI proxy, FastAPI, or similar).
- Restart the Docker Compose stack.
- Verify the embedding proxy is running and accessible at `localhost:9009`.
- Rerun the ingestion and end-to-end test scripts to confirm full pipeline functionality.

### Key Files
- `docker/docker-compose.yml` — orchestrates all services.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `scripts/quick_ingest_neo4j.py`, `scripts/example_ingest.py` — data ingestion scripts.
- `scripts/run_e2e_test.py` — end-to-end pipeline test.
- `.env` — environment variables (ensure all required variables are set).

### Environment
- Python virtual environment: `.venv` (active and working)
- All other services run in Docker containers.

```
You are continuing work on the “Semantic Vault” vector search pipeline project.

**Current State:**
- The project is a multi-container, Docker Compose–orchestrated stack for vector search and knowledge graph operations.
- All Python dependencies are installed in a `.venv` virtual environment.
- The Docker Compose stack launches and runs `neo4j`, `graphiti`, `anythingllm`, and `qdrant` containers successfully.
- Ingestion and test scripts are present and ready to run.
- The README is comprehensive and up-to-date.

**Blocker:**
- The embedding proxy service (required for `/v1/embeddings` on port 9009) is NOT running.
    - This service is essential for generating vector embeddings during ingestion and search.
    - The ingestion/test scripts fail because they cannot connect to this endpoint.
- The Docker Compose file does NOT currently include a service for the embedding proxy.

**Next Steps:**
1. Update `docker/docker-compose.yml` to add an embedding proxy service (e.g., Ollama OpenAI proxy, FastAPI, or similar).
2. Restart the Docker Compose stack.
3. Verify the embedding proxy is running and accessible at `localhost:9009`.
4. Rerun the ingestion and end-to-end test scripts to confirm full pipeline functionality.

**Key Files:**
- `docker/docker-compose.yml` — orchestrates all services.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies.
- `scripts/quick_ingest_neo4j.py`, `scripts/example_ingest.py` — data ingestion scripts.
- `scripts/run_e2e_test.py` — end-to-end pipeline test.
- `.env` — environment variables (ensure all required variables are set).

**Environment:**
- Python virtual environment: `.venv` (active and working)
- All other services run in Docker containers.

**Immediate Action Required:**
- Add and start the embedding proxy service in Docker Compose to unblock the ingestion and testing pipeline.

Please continue from here, ensuring the embedding proxy is running, and validate the entire vector search pipeline end-to-end.
```

## Additional Tips for the Next AI
- If the embedding proxy is Ollama-based, use the `ghcr.io/jerryjliu/ollama-openai:latest` image as a starting point.
- If you need a custom embedding proxy, ensure it is OpenAI-compatible and exposes `/v1/embeddings` on port 9009.
- Always check service health with `docker compose ps` and endpoint availability with `curl`.
