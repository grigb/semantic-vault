# Introduction to the Semantic Stack

Welcome! This document explains, in plain language, what tools are used in our semantic stack and what you can do with them—no technical background required.

## What Is the Semantic Stack?

The semantic stack is a set of tools that helps us:
- Connect people’s needs and resources by meaning, not just keywords
- Organize and search information in smarter ways
- Make personalized suggestions and discover new connections

## What Tools Are Used?

### 1. **Embedding Proxy**
- **What it does:** Turns text (needs, offers, notes) into numbers (called "vector embeddings") that represent their meaning.
- **Why it matters:** Lets us compare and match things by meaning, even if the words are different.

### 2. **Vector Search Pipeline**
- **What it does:** Stores and searches all these embeddings quickly, so we can find what’s most relevant.
- **Why it matters:** Makes it easy to find similar needs, resources, or people—even across large amounts of information.

### 3. **Semantic Vault**
- **What it does:** Brings all the above together, making it possible to search, group, and analyze our data semantically.
- **Why it matters:** Powers smarter search, recommendations, and organization.

## What Can We Do With This?

- **Smart Matching:**
  - Connect people who have similar needs or resources, even if they describe them differently.
- **Semantic Search:**
  - Find the most relevant people, events, or resources by meaning—not just by keywords.
- **Automatic Grouping:**
  - Group similar needs, offers, or ideas together automatically.
- **Duplicate Detection:**
  - Spot when multiple people are looking for or offering the same thing.
