## Introduction
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AnythingLLM system integrated with a local Ollama LLM backend. It explains the architecture, user experience, and what users should expect when interacting with the system.

## System Architecture

### 1. **Frontend (Rust/Egui/AnythingLLM UI)**
- Presents a web-based interface for chat, document upload, and workspace management.
- Allows users to create workspaces, upload files, and interact with the LLM.

### 2. **Backend (AnythingLLM in Docker)**
- Manages workspaces, document embedding, chat history, and LLM interactions.
- Connects to Ollama as the local LLM provider for all chat and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) tasks.
- Embedding pipeline uses a native embedder or a patched OpenAI-compatible local embedding server.

### 3. **Ollama (Local LLM)**
- Serves the LLM model (e.g., `llama3.1:latest`) for chat and document-aware inference.
- Runs locally for privacy, speed, and cost-effectiveness.

### 4. **Database (SQLite)**
- Stores all metadata: workspaces, documents, chat history, vector embeddings, and configuration.

## User Workflow
1. **Start the System:**
   - Launch AnythingLLM (Docker) and ensure Ollama is running locally.
2. **Create a Workspace:**
   - Use the UI to create a new workspace for your project or topic.
3. **Upload Documents:**
   - Drag-and-drop or use the UI to upload files. These are embedded and indexed for search and RAG.
4. **Chat and Search:**
   - Use the chat interface to ask questions, summarize, or search across your documents. The system uses the local LLM and embedded vectors to provide answers.
5. **Explore Data:**
   - Use agent commands (e.g., `list-documents`, `summarize-document`) or search queries to audit and explore injected data.

---

## What to Expect
- **Privacy:** All LLM inference and embedding is localâ€”no data leaves your machine.
- **Speed:** Fast responses, limited only by local hardware.
- **Document Awareness:** The LLM can summarize, search, and answer questions using your uploaded files.
- **Extensibility:** You can add more models, agents, or integrations as needed.
- **Automation:** Most flows (setup, embedding, chat) are automated for ease of use.

---

## Troubleshooting
- If chat does not work, ensure the workspace LLM provider and model are set (see database/workspace config).
- Check Docker and Ollama logs for errors.
- Restart services if you change configuration.

---

## Security
- No OpenAI API key is needed unless you want to use cloud LLMs.
- Auth is optional for local-only setups.
