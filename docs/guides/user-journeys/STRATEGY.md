# Strategy for Designing, Documenting, and Testing User Journeys

## 1. User Journey Framework
- Define a "user journey" as a step-by-step experience a user (or agent) has while achieving a meaningful goal in the system.
- Identify key personas: new user, admin, power user, integrator, etc.
- Journeys should cover onboarding, core workflows, troubleshooting, and advanced use cases.

## 2. Documentation Structure
- All user journeys are documented as individual Markdown files in `/docs/guides/user-journeys/`.
- Each journey uses the [TEMPLATE.md](./TEMPLATE.md) for consistency.
- Journeys are linked from the main documentation index and onboarding guides.

## 3. Prioritization
- Start with high-value journeys: onboarding, search, data ingestion, notification management, troubleshooting.
- Regularly review and expand the set of documented journeys as the platform evolves.

## 4. Testing User Journeys
- Each journey includes a "Testing Checklist" section for manual or automated validation.
- Testing may be performed by:
  - Manual walkthrough using the guide
  - Automated end-to-end (E2E) tests (where feasible)
  - Checklist validation after major releases
- Store automated test scripts (if any) in `/tests/user_journeys/` or reference them from the journey doc.

## 5. Continuous Improvement
- Encourage feedback from users and contributors on each journey doc.
- Regularly revisit and update journeys as features, UIs, or APIs change.
- Add new journeys for new features or user roles.

## 6. Ownership & Maintenance
- Assign a maintainer or team to review journey docs quarterly.
- Document the process for suggesting edits or reporting issues (see TEMPLATE.md).

This strategy should be reviewed and refined as the platform and user base grow. All team members and contributors are encouraged to participate in journey design and testing.
