## Test Entries

### Journey: Semantic Search
Date: 2025-04-27
Tester: AI
Result: Success (API responded with empty but valid results)
Notes: 
- Backend at port 9003 is running and exposes `/search`.
- Mock embedding service was started on port 9009 to unblock testing.
- Search API responds correctly (returns empty `facts` list when no data is ingested).
- Next: Ingest data and re-test for non-empty results, or proceed to the next user journey.
