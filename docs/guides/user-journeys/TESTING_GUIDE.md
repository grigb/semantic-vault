# User Journey Testing Guide

This guide describes how to test user journeys for the Semantic Vault platform. It covers both manual and (future) automated testing, ensuring each documented journey is reliable, accurate, and user-friendly.

---

## 1. Manual Testing Process

### a. Preparation
- Ensure the platform and all relevant services are running and healthy.
- Review the journey doc and its "Preconditions" section.

### b. Walkthrough
- Follow each step in the journey doc exactly as written.
- At each step, verify the expected input/output and note any discrepancies.
- Use the "Edge Cases & Variations" section to test alternate flows or error scenarios.

### c. Checklist Validation
- Complete the "Testing Checklist" at the end of the journey doc.
- Mark each item as complete or note any failures/blockers.

### d. Reporting
- Record results (success, failure, issues) in a test log or GitHub Issue.
- Suggest improvements to the journey doc or underlying feature as needed.

## 2. Automated Testing (Future)
- Where feasible, implement automated end-to-end (E2E) tests for user journeys.
- Store scripts in `/tests/user_journeys/` and link them from the relevant journey doc.
- Automated tests should mirror the manual steps and validate both success and edge cases.

---

## 3. Continuous Improvement
- Re-test journeys after major updates or releases.
- Encourage all contributors to run journey tests before merging changes.
- Update journey docs and tests as features, APIs, or UIs evolve.
