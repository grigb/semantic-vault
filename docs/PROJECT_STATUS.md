# Project Status & Operational Record

_Last updated: 2025-04-24T23:02:49-06:00_

## Current State & Milestones

- **Repository Cleanliness:**
  - All build artifacts, dependency folders, and vault data are now ignored via `.gitignore` and removed from git tracking.
  - Only source code, documentation, and configuration files are tracked.

- **Documentation:**
  - Documentation is consolidated, cross-linked, and indexed in `docs/README.md`.
  - All duplicate Graphiti documentation files were removed from `docs/graphiti/`; originals are maintained in the upstream `graphiti` repo.

- **Graphiti Directory:**
  - `graphiti` is a clone of `https://github.com/getzep/graphiti.git` (not a submodule, but a nested repo).
  - There is a local commit for a patch to support local LLM proxy and a custom Dockerfile. This is not yet merged upstream. (Commit: 0938974203e1b1b1f11444cd1fd968fd3b965772)

- **Cursor Rules & Architecture:**
  - All cursor rules and architectural docs are up to date and referenced in `docs/README.md`.

## Next Steps

- Run and deploy the system locally.
- Ensure end-to-end operation with a local LLM (e.g., Ollama).
- Verify system completeness and functionality.

## Recordkeeping & Maintenance Guidance

- Use this `PROJECT_STATUS.md` as a living operational log: update with major milestones, architectural or repo changes, deployment notes, and anything relevant for future maintainers.
- Avoid scattering status notes in multiple files; keep this as the single source of truth for project operational state.
- Reference this file in onboarding or handoff documentation so future contributors know where to look for project status and history.
