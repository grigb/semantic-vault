# Collaborative Systems Architecture (CSA)

The Collaborative Systems Architecture (CSA) is a set of principles and technical patterns for building modular, privacy-focused, and extensible AI systems. It emphasizes:

- Local-first, user-owned data and compute
- Modular components with clear APIs and boundaries
- Semantic memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Strong auditability and transparency
- Multi-agent and multi-user collaboration
