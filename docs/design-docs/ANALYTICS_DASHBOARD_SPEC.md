# Analytics Dashboard & Visualization Design Spec

## Purpose
Design a modern, extensible analytics dashboard for the Semantic System. The dashboard will provide actionable insights into system usage, LLM/API performance, ingestion activity, and user behavior, supporting both operational monitoring and product improvement.

---

## 1. Core Features
- **System Usage Metrics:**
  - Number of LLM/API calls (by provider, by endpoint)
  - Embedding requests, ingestion jobs, Q&A sessions
  - Active users/sessions
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Latency and error rates per provider/model
  - Success/failure rates by endpoint
  - Resource utilization (RAM, CPU if available)
- **Ingestion & Content Metrics:**
  - Docs/notes/pages ingested, chunked, indexed
  - Largest/smallest docs, ingestion time, chunk size distribution
- **User Behavior:**
  - Most common queries/tasks
  - Session duration, feature adoption

## 2. Visualization & UI
- Modern, interactive dashboard (charts, tables, filters)
- Real-time and historical views (last hour, day, week, custom)
- Drill-down and export (CSV/JSON)
- Alerting for failures or anomalies

## 3. Data Sources
- System logs and API request logs
- Internal events (ingestion, LLM calls, errors)
- Usage tracking (opt-in, privacy-respecting)

## 4. Extensibility & Security
- Modular widgets/components for easy extension
- Role-based access (admin, user)
- Secure handling of sensitive data

## 5. Implementation Plan
- Phase 1: Spec & UI mockups
- Phase 2: Backend metrics collection & API
- Phase 3: Frontend dashboard integration
- Phase 4: Alerting, export, advanced analytics
