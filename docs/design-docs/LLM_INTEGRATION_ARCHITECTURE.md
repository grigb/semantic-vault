# LLM Integration Architecture Design

## Purpose
Define a robust, extensible architecture for integrating local and API-based LLMs (Large Language Models) into the Semantic System. Specify routing logic, configuration, security, and operational best practices.

---

## 1. Supported LLM Providers (Initial Scope)
- **Local Runners:**
  - Ollama
  - LM Studio
- **API Providers:**
  - OpenAI (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.)
  - Anthropic (Claude)
  - (Extensible: add others as needed)

---

## 2. Task Routing Logic
- Requests to the LLM endpoint can be routed based on:
  - User/project configuration (preferred/default model)
  - Task type (Q&A, summarization, chat, etc.)
  - Availability/fallback (if primary model fails)
- Routing logic is modular and easily extended for new providers or policies.

---

## 3. Security & Credential Management
- API keys and credentials are stored in environment variables or secure secrets storage (never hardcoded).
- Local LLM runners are sandboxed and can be started/stopped by the service.
- All LLM access is logged for audit and debugging.

---

## 4. Switching & Fallback Mechanisms
- Users/admins can switch the active LLM via API or UI.
- If a model or provider is unavailable, fallback to a secondary provider (configurable).
- All switches and failures are logged and surfaced in the health dashboard.

---

## 5. Configuration & Extensibility
- All LLM providers and routing logic are defined in a config file or environment variables.
- Adding a new provider requires only minimal code changes (plug-in architecture).

## 7. Next Steps
- Review and approve this architecture.
- Implement backend logic for LLM integration and routing.
- Update API and UI to support switching and fallback.
- Add tests and documentation.
