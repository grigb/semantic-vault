# Notification & Automation Feature Plan

## Purpose
Enable the Semantic Vault system to alert users and trigger automated workflows in response to key events (e.g., ingestion complete, error, workflow success).

## Requirements
- In-app notifications (core, MVP)
- Extensible for future email/webhook/third-party integrations
- API endpoints:
  - POST /v1/notify: Send a notification
  - GET /v1/notifications: List notifications
  - POST /v1/notifications/read: Mark as read
- Notification types: info, warning, error, success, alert
- User targeting (optional, for multi-user scenarios)
- Triggers: Ingestion events, errors, workflow completions, admin actions

## Architecture
- Backend: FastAPI notification service (modular, in-memory for MVP)
- Models: Notification, NotificationType
- Service: send_notification, get_notifications, mark_as_read
- Future: Add persistent store (DB/queue), external integrations

## UI Integration
- Notification center or toast alerts in frontend (planned)
- API integration for fetching and marking notifications

## Next Steps
1. Integrate backend notification triggers with ingestion, errors, and workflow events
2. Add frontend notification UI
3. Extend to persistent storage and/or external notification channels as needed
