# AI Handover Document: Phase 2 and Beyond

---

## Purpose
This document is a handover and onboarding guide for a new AI assistant or developer responsible for continuing the Semantic System project from Phase 2 onward. It summarizes the current state, project structure, design decisions, and provides clear instructions for picking up development with full context.

---

## 1. Project State Summary
- **Phase 1 (Foundation):** Complete. Embedding proxy, vector search pipeline, ingestion, E2E testing, and Dockerization are all done and tested.
- **Documentation:** Fully reorganized. All docs are now under `/docs/` with clear subdirectories for planning, design, onboarding, guides, and components. See `/docs/README.md` for navigation.
- **Current Phase:** Ready to begin Phase 2 â€” Unified Model Management & Web Interface (see `/docs/planning/SEMANTIC_SYSTEM_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md`).

---

## 2. Key Documents and Navigation
- **Project Index:** `/docs/README.md` (start here)
- **Master Checklist:** `/docs/planning/SEMANTIC_SYSTEM_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md`
- **Strategy & Vision:** `/docs/planning/SEMANTIC_SYSTEM_STRATEGY.md`, `/docs/planning/SEMANTIC_SYSTEM_FULL_VISION.md`
- **Design Docs:** `/docs/design-docs/` (e.g., `MODEL_CATALOG_API_DESIGN.md`)
- **Onboarding:** `/docs/onboarding/TEAM_INTRO_TO_SEMANTIC_STACK.md`, `/docs/onboarding/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`
- **Guides:** `/docs/guides/`
- **Component Docs:** `/docs/graphiti/` and future `/docs/<component>/`
- **Cursor Rules:** `/.cursor/rules/` (agent/AI onboarding, doc maintenance, and best practices)

---

## 3. Immediate Next Steps
- Review `/docs/planning/SEMANTIC_SYSTEM_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md` for prioritized Phase 2 tasks.
- Begin with model catalog API design/spec and implementation (see `/docs/design-docs/MODEL_CATALOG_API_DESIGN.md`).
- Follow checklist for API endpoints, shared model storage, web UI, Obsidian integration, Q&A, system health, and documentation.
- Maintain modularity, test after each step, and update docs as you go.

---

## 4. Best Practices
- Always update `/docs/README.md` and relevant planning/design docs with new features or changes.
- Use `/docs/planning/PROJECT_STATUS.md` for operational notes and milestone tracking.
- Reference `/.cursor/rules/` for onboarding, doc structure, and agent workflow rules.
- Document all decisions, blockers, and integration points.
- Keep onboarding and navigation up to date for future AI/human contributors.
