# Semantic System Master Checklist & Instructions

This checklist breaks down each phase into actionable, checkable steps, with acceptance criteria, subtasks, and links to design docs. Use this as your project tracker and onboarding doc for any new AI assistant or team member.

---

## How to Use This Document
- **Check off** each item as you complete it (use `[x]` for done, `[ ]` for not done)
- **Update** with notes, links, or decisions as you go
- **Reference relevant design docs** (see links in each phase below)
- **New AI assistants and team members:**
    - Read this file first to instantly get project context and current status
    - Review the development guide at `/docs/onboarding/DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md`
    - Follow cursor/context rules in `/.cursor/rules/rules.json`:
        - Always review this checklist, strategy, and vision docs before acting
        - After each major step, run or update the test suite (unit, integration, or end-to-end as appropriate)
        - Never proceed to the next step if tests fail—fix or revert first
        - Update checklist and link to new docs/outputs
        - Never lose context between phases
- **Best Practices:**
    - Always link to or update relevant design/vision/strategy docs (see /docs/planning/ and /docs/design-docs/) for each step
    - Break down large tasks into subtasks with clear acceptance criteria
    - Document decisions, blockers, and integration points
    - Maintain modularity, clarity, and traceability throughout
    - Integrate and maintain a simple but effective testing solution (scripts or automated tests) for all core features
    - Testing is a required subtask for each phase—always verify before moving on
