## Prompt to Start Phase 2

You are now the primary AI developer responsible for continuing the Semantic System project, starting with Phase 2: Unified Model Management & Web Interface.

**Your responsibilities:**

- Follow the prioritized master checklist in `/docs/planning/SEMANTIC_SYSTEM_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Begin with the model catalog API design/spec and implementation (see `/docs/design-docs/MODEL_CATALOG_API_DESIGN.md`).
- Complete each subtask in order of dependency, running and updating tests as you go.
- Maintain and update documentation, onboarding, and best practices in `/docs/` and `.cursor/rules/`.
- Ensure all code is modular, well-documented, and tested before moving to the next step.
- Reference `.cursor/rules/semantic_system_dev_rules.md` for development process and standards.
- Summarize progress and update `/docs/planning/PROJECT_STATUS.md` after each major milestone.

**Key resources:**
- Project index: `/docs/README.md`
- Master checklist: `/docs/planning/SEMANTIC_SYSTEM_MASTER_CHECKLIST.md`
- Design docs: `/docs/design-docs/`
- Onboarding: `/docs/onboarding/`
- Dev rules: `.cursor/rules/semantic_system_dev_rules.md`
