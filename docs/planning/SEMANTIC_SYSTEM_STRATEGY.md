# Semantic System Build Strategy & Phases

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- Embedding proxy service (SentenceTransformers, OpenAI-compatible)
- Vector search pipeline (Neo4j, Qdrant, Graphiti)
- Ingestion, search, and end-to-end testing
- Dockerized services
- Documentation for setup and usage

---

## Phase 2: Unified Model Management & Web Interface
- Add model catalog (local + Hugging Face/remote)
- API endpoints for install/list/switch (embedding & LLM models)
- Build web UI for model management, testing, and switching
- Enable shared model storage across containers/projects

---

## Phase 3: LLM Integration & Task Routing
- Integrate local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.) and API-based LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Add task router to direct requests to embedding or LLM as appropriate
- Support prompt engineering and chunking for long documents
- UI: chat with data, Q&A, rewriting, summarization

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Multi-Modal Support
- Analytics dashboard (usage, resource, trends)
- Visualizations (character arcs, entity networks, etc.)
- Multi-modal support (images, audio, etc.)
- Notification and automation features

---

## Phase 5: Portability & Integration
- Ensure all features run in a single Docker container
- Support for volume mounts and shared model/data storage
- Easy import/integration into other projects
- Finalize documentation and onboarding for technical/non-technical users

---

## Guiding Principles
- Modularity: Each part can be extended or swapped
- User-centric: Web UI for all major interactions
- Portability: Easy to move, copy, and integrate
- Privacy & Efficiency: Use local resources when possible, APIs as fallback

---

*This strategy should be reviewed and updated at each phase milestone.*
