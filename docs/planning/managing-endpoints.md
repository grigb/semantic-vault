# Managing API Endpoints: Strategy, Rules, and Best Practices

This document defines the strategy, rules, and operational practices for managing, documenting, and testing API endpoints in this project. It is intended to ensure the API surface is always complete, reliable, and aligned with the evolving needs of the product and its users.

---

## 1. Status Rules for Endpoints

All endpoints in `docs/user/endpoints.md` must use one of the following status values:

- **working**: Implemented and confirmed functional
- **broken**: Implemented but not working as intended
- **untested**: Implemented but not yet tested
- **missing**: Not implemented in the codebase at all; only implied or desired
- **deprecated**: Implemented but no longer intended for use (if applicable)

**Rule:** The status must be kept up-to-date as endpoints are added, tested, fixed, or deprecated.

---

## 2. Approach to Endpoint Analysis and Documentation

- **Inventory First:** Always begin by extracting all endpoints from the codebase and documentation.
- **Categorize:** Group endpoints by feature area (e.g., Model Management, Analytics, Integrations, etc.).
- **Cross-Reference:** Compare code vs. documentation to find missing or undocumented endpoints.
- **CRUD Completeness:** For each entity or feature, ensure all Create, Read, Update, Delete operations are represented and marked as `missing` if not implemented.
- **Document Everything:** All endpoints—implemented or planned—must be listed in `docs/user/endpoints.md` with status and description.

---

## 3. Review and Update Process

- Treat `docs/user/endpoints.md` as the **single source of truth** for all API endpoints.
- When adding a new feature, update this document first with the new endpoint(s) and set status to `missing` until implemented.
- When implementing or changing endpoints, update the status and details in the document immediately.
- Regularly review the document for accuracy, especially before releases.

---

## 4. Keeping Endpoints Updated as Features Evolve

- **Feature Planning:** Before starting work on a new feature, update the endpoints doc to reflect any new or changed endpoints.
- **Implementation:** Developers must keep the doc in sync with code changes.
- **Code Review:** No PR touching endpoints is complete unless the endpoints doc is updated and accurate.
- **Deprecation:** Mark deprecated endpoints clearly and provide migration guidance if needed.

---

## 5. Testing and Hardening the API

- **Automated Tests:** Maintain a comprehensive suite of automated tests that cover every endpoint in the documentation.
- **Regression Testing:** Run all endpoint tests after every change to detect regressions or breaking changes early.
- **Test Coverage:** Ensure tests cover not only the happy path but also edge cases, error handling, and permissions.
- **Continuous Integration:** Integrate endpoint tests into CI/CD pipelines so failures block merges until resolved.
- **Manual Validation:** For complex or new endpoints, manual walkthroughs using the user journey guides are encouraged.
- **Test Documentation:** Each endpoint in `docs/user/endpoints.md` should reference relevant test cases or scripts where possible.

---

## 6. Moving Toward a Complete, Hardened API

- **Finalized Document:** The goal is for the entire project to be based on the finalized `docs/user/endpoints.md`.
- **No Orphan Endpoints:** All implemented endpoints must be documented; all documented endpoints must be accounted for in code or marked as `missing`.
- **Proactive Maintenance:** Regularly revisit endpoints as features are added, changed, or removed.
- **Feedback Loop:** Encourage feedback from users and contributors on endpoint design, completeness, and documentation.

---

## 7. Best Practices

- Use clear, consistent naming and versioning for endpoints.
- Prefer RESTful conventions and HTTP status codes.
- Document sample requests and responses for every endpoint.
- Group endpoints logically for discoverability.
- Secure endpoints appropriately and document authentication/authorization requirements.
- Continuously improve based on user feedback and evolving requirements.

**By following this strategy and set of rules, the project will maintain a robust, discoverable, and reliable API surface that supports rapid development and high trust from users and integrators.**
