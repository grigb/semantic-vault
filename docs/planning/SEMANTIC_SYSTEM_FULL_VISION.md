# Semantic System: Full Vision & Roadmap

---

## 1. The Big Picture: What We Want to Build

Our goal is to create a modular, portable, and user-friendly AI-powered system that can:
- Ingest, analyze, and semantically search vast, complex data (e.g., novels, knowledge bases, notes)
- Support both vector embedding and LLM (Large Language Model) tasks: search, summarization, Q&A, rewriting, planning, etc.
- Integrate local (on-device) and remote (API/cloud) models, with seamless switching and unified management
- Provide a web interface for all interactions: upload, search, chat, model management, analytics, and more
- Run in a single Docker container, supporting shared model storage and easy portability/integration

### Example Use Case: Book/Novel Analysis
- Ingest a multi-chapter book
- Analyze character arcs: what a character does, who they interact with, how they grow
- Let users ask questions about the book and get meaningful answers
- Enable prompt engineering, chunking, and advanced querying

## 2. Key Components

### A. **Unified Model Management**
- Discover, install, and switch between embedding models and LLMs (local or remote)
- Share model data across projects/containers to save space
- Support both Hugging Face (SentenceTransformers, LLMs), Ollama, LM Studio, and API-based models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### B. **Task Router**
- Automatically route requests to the appropriate model/service: embedding, LLM, or hybrid
- Support advanced prompt engineering and chunking for long documents

### C. **Web Interface**
- Browse, upload, and manage data (books, notes, etc.)
- Search semantically, ask questions, chat with data
- Manage models (install, test, switch)
- Monitor resource usage, see analytics, and run tests
- All features accessible in-browser, no CLI required

### D. **Portable, Containerized Deployment**
- Everything runs in a single Docker container
- Supports volume mounts for shared models/data
- Easy to copy, move, or integrate into other projects

### E. **Integration with Local and API-Based Solutions**
- Use local models for privacy/speed/cost
- Fall back to or augment with API-based models for advanced tasks or when local resources are insufficient

## 3. What This Enables
- Deep analysis of large texts (e.g., character arcs in novels)
- Semantic Q&A and conversation with any dataset
- Building new tools: story editors, planners, recommendation engines, etc.
- Easy integration into other projects and workflows

---

## 4. Whatâ€™s Missing & Next Steps
- Unified web UI for all features
- Robust task routing and prompt engineering
- LLM integration (local and API)
- Model/data sharing between containers
- Advanced analytics and reporting
