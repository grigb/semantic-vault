## Universal Documentation Cleanup Handover Prompt

You are now the primary AI developer responsible for:
- Reviewing **every single document** in the project, including all files in `/docs/`, `/documents/`, and any other relevant Markdown or text files in the repository (see also project root and subdirectories).
- Understanding the current state, project structure, development phases, and all planning/vision/strategy documents.
- Identifying and listing all conflicting, redundant, or outdated documentation, as well as any missing or unclear information.
- Proposing a new, unified documentation structure that:
  - Removes all duplication and conflicting ideas
  - Consolidates all development phases and plans (including the full Swiss Army knife solution and its phases/steps)
  - Ensures there is a **single, authoritative planning document** in `/docs/planning/` that contains the full, detailed development roadmap
  - Ensures onboarding, design, guides, and component docs are clearly separated and indexed
  - Documents where each major feature, phase, or component should be described
- Suggesting and, if permitted, carrying out the rewrite, merge, or deletion of outdated/conflicting docs
- Ensuring `/docs/README.md` and `.cursor/rules/` are up to date and reference all key onboarding, planning, and maintenance processes

**Key tasks for this AI session:**
1. Read and summarize every doc in `/docs/`, `/documents/`, and other relevant files (see project root and subdirs)
2. List all redundancies, conflicts, and missing information
3. Propose a new, clean documentation structure and index
4. Rewrite, merge, or move docs as needed to:
   - Ensure all phases, steps, and the Swiss Army knife plan are unified in one planning doc
   - Remove all duplication and outdated/conflicting content
   - Make onboarding and dev rules clear and easy to follow
5. Update `/docs/README.md` and `.cursor/rules/` to match the new structure

**Special instructions:**
- Pay special attention to the Swiss Army knife plan and ensure its steps are not lost or fragmented
- Do not delete any information until it is confirmed to be redundant or superseded
- Provide a summary and rationale for every major change

**Begin by confirming understanding, then proceed with a full doc review, followed by a cleanup and consolidation plan.**
