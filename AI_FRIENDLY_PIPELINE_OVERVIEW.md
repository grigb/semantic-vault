# AI-Friendly System & Pipeline Overview

This document provides a comprehensive, self-contained technical and conceptual overview of the AnythingLLM + Ollama toolset and pipeline. It is designed for AI agents, developers, and system architects who need robust persistent memory, semantic search, schema flexibility, and multi-agent project management. All details are included here—no external references required.

## 1. System Purpose & Philosophy

This system is a **local-first, privacy-focused, modular platform** for:
- Persistent, queryable memory for AI and human workflows
- Project and knowledge management across teams, devices, and timescales
- Semantic search, retrieval, and context-aware chat using local LLMs and embeddings
- Schema-on-demand storage for any data, supporting evolving and complex projects

It is suitable as a backend for autonomous agents, copilots, collaborative tools, or as a standalone knowledge/project management engine.

## 2. Architecture & Pipeline (Step-by-Step)

### **A. Data Ingestion & Storage**
- Users or agents upload documents, create tasks, or add notes via web UI, API, or CLI.
- Data is stored in a local SQLite database (optionally Neo4j for graph use cases).
- **Schema Flexibility:**
  - Tables include `workspaces`, `workspace_documents`, `chat_history`, `tasks`, and more.
  - Arbitrary metadata (JSON) can be attached to any entity (e.g., document, task, user).
  - New columns, tables, or data types can be added on demand—no rigid schema lock-in.
- **Example:**
  - A workspace might store: `{id, name, description, createdAt, metadata}`
  - A document record: `{id, workspaceId, filename, docpath, metadata, createdAt}`

### **B. Embedding & Indexing**
- All text data (documents, notes, chat, etc.) is sent to a local embedding server:
  - Default: FastAPI server running SentenceTransformer (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
  - Supports Apple Silicon GPU (MPS) or CPU
  - Embedding server exposes `/embeddings` endpoint for batch encoding
- Embeddings are stored in the database alongside the original data
- **No external API keys or cloud calls required**
- **Example:**
  - POST `{ "sentences": ["Project kickoff agenda", "Design doc for v2"] }` to `/embeddings` returns a vector for each input

### **C. Semantic Search & Retrieval**
- Semantic search is available via REST API, CLI, or direct DB queries
- Query pipeline:
  1. User/agent submits a query (e.g., "Show all tasks related to onboarding")
  2. Query is embedded using the local embedding server
  3. System computes vector similarity (cosine or other) against stored embeddings
  4. Returns top-matching documents, tasks, or chat snippets, with metadata and context
- **Example:**
  - POST `{ "query": "How do I deploy?", "group_ids": ["projectX"] }` to `/search` returns relevant docs and their snippets

### **D. Chat & Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Local LLM (Ollama or compatible) serves as the chat/completion engine
- Chat interface (UI or API) supports:
  - Context-aware Q&A, summarization, task generation
  - Retrieval of supporting facts from project memory
  - Multi-turn conversations, with persistent chat history
- **Example:**
  - User or agent asks: "Summarize recent architecture changes"
  - System retrieves relevant docs, feeds them to LLM, and returns a summary

### **E. Project & Task Management**
- Workspaces encapsulate projects, teams, or domains
- Each workspace has:
  - Documents, chat history, tasks, milestones, and arbitrary metadata
  - Role-based access and audit logging (optional)
- Tasks can be created, assigned, searched, and updated by users or agents
- **Example:**
  - Agent creates a task: `{ "title": "Refactor search pipeline", "assignedTo": "AI_Copilot", "due": "2025-05-01" }`

## 3. APIs, Extensibility, and Automation

- **REST Endpoints:** For search, embedding, chat, document/task CRUD, and workspace management
- **CLI Tools:** For ingestion, search, health checks, and automation
- **Embeddable:** Can be used as a backend for any custom UI or agent
- **Event Hooks & Plugins:** (Planned) Agents can register to receive events (e.g., new doc, task completion)
- **Schema Evolution:** Add new tables/fields at runtime for new data types or workflows
- **Example API Call:**
  - `POST /v1/embeddings` with `{ "input": ["text"], "model": "local" }` returns OpenAI-compatible embedding format

---

## 4. Data Flow Example (End-to-End)

1. **Ingest:** User uploads `design_doc.md` to workspace "Alpha"
2. **Embed:** System calls `/embeddings` to encode the document
3. **Store:** Document, embedding, and metadata are stored in DB
4. **Search:** Agent queries for "design decisions"; system embeds query and retrieves top-matching docs
5. **Chat:** Agent asks LLM to summarize retrieved docs or generate next steps
6. **Task:** Agent creates a follow-up task, which is stored and indexed for future retrieval

---

## 5. Technical Details & Behaviors

- **Local-Only by Default:** No data leaves the machine unless explicitly configured
- **Performance:** Embedding and search are fast and parallelized; LLM inference is local
- **Multi-User:** Supports many users, agents, and devices concurrently
- **Auditability:** All actions (uploads, queries, chat, task changes) can be logged for compliance
- **Backup & Restore:** DB and embeddings can be exported/imported for disaster recovery
- **Security:** No cloud keys required; optional auth for local or shared deployments
- **Customization:** Scripts and plugins can extend ingestion, search, or agent behaviors

---

## 6. Example Use Cases

- **AI Project Manager:** Remembers every decision, file, and conversation for years
- **Autonomous Agents:** Resume complex tasks after days, weeks, or months, with full context
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration:** Teams and AIs work together, sharing persistent memory and project state
- **Long-Term R&D:** Manage evolving requirements, knowledge, and contributors over multi-year timelines
- **Private Knowledge Base:** Robust, extensible, and fully local for sensitive projects

---

## 7. Key Advantages for AI Projects

- **Persistence:** All memory, context, and project data is stored locally and can be queried or updated at any time
- **Schema Flexibility:** Add new data types, relationships, or metadata as your project evolves
- **Privacy & Control:** No data leaves your machine unless you explicitly enable cloud features
- **Scalability:** Designed for long-term, multi-user, multi-system projects
- **AI-Ready:** Built to be a drop-in backend for autonomous agents, copilots, or collaborative AI systems
- **Automation:** Health checks, ingestion, and search can be fully automated
- **Extensibility:** New workflows, data types, and plugins can be added as needs evolve
