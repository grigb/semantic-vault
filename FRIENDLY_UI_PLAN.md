# Friendly Frontend UI Design Plan for AnythingLLM + Ollama

## Vision
Design a modern, intuitive, and beautiful frontend UI that makes interacting with AnythingLLM + Ollama seamless for both technical and non-technical users. The UI should:
- Make onboarding and workspace management effortless
- Offer clear feedback and guidance
- Enable easy document upload, search, and chat
- Showcase the power of local LLM and RAG features
- Be responsive, accessible, and visually appealing

---

## Core Features
1. **Landing Page / Onboarding**
   - Welcome message and quickstart guide
   - Workspace selector/creator
   - System status indicators (Ollama, embedding, backend health)

2. **Workspace Dashboard**
   - List of all workspaces with recent activity
   - Quick links to create, rename, or delete workspaces

3. **Document Management**
   - Drag-and-drop upload with progress
   - List of embedded documents with metadata (name, upload date, chunk count)
   - Inline previews/snippets for each document
   - Document actions: summarize, delete, download

4. **Chat & RAG Interface**
   - Chat window with conversation history
   - Rich markdown rendering (code, tables, citations)
   - Contextual suggestions (e.g., "summarize this document")
   - File-aware chat (attach document context to questions)

5. **Search & Analytics**
   - Search bar for keywords across all documents
   - Filters by document, date, tags
   - Analytics dashboard: document count, queries, top docs

6. **Agent & Plugin System**
   - Easy access to built-in and user-defined agent commands
   - Plugin marketplace (future)

7. **Settings & Help**
   - LLM model/provider selector
   - System/environment diagnostics
   - Help, docs, and feedback links

## UX Principles
- **Clarity:** Clear calls to action, tooltips, and progress indicators
- **Responsiveness:** Works on desktop and mobile
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Feedback:** All actions provide immediate feedback (success, error, loading)
- **Consistency:** Cohesive color scheme and iconography

---

## Tech Stack Recommendation
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS (or Chakra UI)
- **State Management:** Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **API:** REST/gRPC client for backend
- **Testing:** Playwright or Cypress for E2E

## Implementation Roadmap
1. Scaffold React app with routing and layout
2. Implement authentication/onboarding flow
3. Build workspace dashboard and document management views
4. Integrate chat and search UI with backend
5. Add agent/plugin system and analytics
6. Polish UI/UX, accessibility, and mobile support
7. Write documentation and onboarding guides

---

## Next Steps
- Create the React app scaffold and implement the landing/onboarding flow.
- Iterate quickly, demoing each feature as it is built.
