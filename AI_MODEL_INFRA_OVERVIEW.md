# AI Model Infrastructure Overview: Local & Remote Capabilities

---

## 1. What You Have Now

### **A. Embedding Proxy (SentenceTransformers-based)**
- **Purpose:** Generates vector embeddings for text (used in search, clustering, semantic vault, etc.)
- **Tech:** FastAPI service, SentenceTransformers models (e.g., `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- **Endpoints:** OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings`, plus model management endpoints
- **Capabilities:**
  - Ingest/query semantic data (e.g., from Obsidian vault)
  - Vector search for facts, notes, etc.
  - Can swap between different embedding models (locally)
- **Limitations:**
  - Does NOT do text generation, summarization, rewriting, or code planning (LLM tasks)
  - Only supports models compatible with SentenceTransformers (for embeddings)

### **B. Vector Search Pipeline**
- **Purpose:** Stores and searches embeddings (Neo4j, Qdrant, Graphiti, etc.)
- **Capabilities:**
  - Semantic search over ingested data
  - End-to-end tested and working
- **Limitations:**
  - Retrieval only as good as the embeddings/models used

---

## 2. What You Want (Swiss Army Knife Vision)

- **Support for both embeddings (vector search) and LLMs (text generation, rewriting, code planning, etc.)**
- **Ability to run and switch between local and remote models for both embeddings and LLMs**
- **A UI or API to manage, install, and use all types of models**
- **Integration with tools like story editors, code planners, and knowledge bases (e.g., Obsidian)**

---

## 3. What Each Tool Does (and Doesn’t)

### **A. Embedding Proxy**
- **Does:** Provides embeddings for semantic search
- **Does NOT:** Generate text, rewrite, plan code, or act as an LLM

### **B. LM Studio**
- **Does:**
  - Browse, download, and run LLMs (for chat/completion) locally
  - Supports many Hugging Face LLMs (Llama, Mistral, etc.)
  - Has a GUI
- **Does NOT:**
  - Provide embeddings for vector search
  - Expose an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/embeddings` endpoint
  - Integrate directly with your current pipeline

### **C. Ollama**
- **Does:**
  - Run LLMs locally
  - Expose a simple API for chat/completion
- **Does NOT:**
  - Provide embeddings by default (unless model supports it and you custom-integrate)
  - Integrate directly with your current embedding proxy

### **D. SentenceTransformers**
- **Does:**
  - Provide a wide range of embedding models for semantic search
  - Used by your embedding proxy
- **Does NOT:**
  - Generate text, chat, or code (not an LLM)

---

## 4. What’s Possible Today

- **You can:**
  - Ingest and search data using vector embeddings (local, via your embedding proxy)
  - Swap between different embedding models (SentenceTransformers)
  - Query your semantic vault (Obsidian, etc.) with vector search
- **You cannot (yet):**
  - Run LLMs for text generation, rewriting, code planning, etc. as part of your pipeline
  - Seamlessly switch between LLMs and embedding models from one UI/API
  - Use LM Studio or Ollama as a drop-in replacement for your embedding proxy

---

## 5. What’s Missing to Make It Complete

- **LLM Integration:**
  - Add support for running LLMs (local/remote) for chat, rewriting, code planning, etc.
  - Option 1: Integrate with Ollama/LM Studio via their APIs for LLM tasks
  - Option 2: Add a local LLM server (e.g., FastChat, OpenChat, etc.)
- **Unified Model Management UI:**
  - Build a web UI to manage both embedding and LLM models (install, switch, use)
- **Task Routing:**
  - Add logic to route requests to the right model/service (embedding vs. LLM)
- **Advanced Features:**
  - Prompt engineering, chunking for long documents, multi-modal support, etc.

---

## 6. What’s Not Possible (Yet)

- **A single app that lets you browse, install, and use both embeddings and LLMs for all tasks, locally and remotely, with seamless switching and task routing.**
- **Using LM Studio or Ollama as a direct drop-in for your current embedding proxy (without custom integration).**
- **LLM-quality on par with ChatGPT/Claude for all tasks locally—local LLMs are improving but may lag behind top cloud models.**

---

## 7. Roadmap: Steps to Get There

1. **Add LLM serving capability (Ollama, LM Studio API, or custom FastAPI wrapper)**
2. **Build/extend the web UI for unified model management and task selection**
3. **Integrate task routing logic (embedding vs. LLM tasks)**
4. **Add advanced features (prompting, chunking, etc.)**

---

## 8. Glossary

- **Embedding Model:** Turns text into vectors for search/semantic tasks (e.g., SentenceTransformers)
- **LLM (Large Language Model):** Generates, rewrites, or analyzes text (e.g., Llama, GPT-3, Claude)
- **Vector Search:** Search using embeddings (semantic similarity)
- **Chat/Completion API:** For LLM chat, code, or text generation tasks
