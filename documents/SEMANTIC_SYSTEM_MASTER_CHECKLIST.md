# Semantic System Master Checklist & Instructions

This checklist breaks down each phase into actionable, checkable steps, with acceptance criteria, subtasks, and links to design docs. Use this as your project tracker and onboarding doc for any new AI assistant or team member.

---

## How to Use This Document
- **Check off** each item as you complete it (use `[x]` for done, `[ ]` for not done)
- **Update** with notes, links, or decisions as you go
- **Reference relevant design docs** (see links in each phase)
- **New AI assistants:**
    - Read this file first to instantly get project context and current status
    - Follow cursor/context rules:
        - Always review this checklist, strategy, and vision docs before acting
        - After each major step, run or update the test suite (unit, integration, or end-to-end as appropriate)
        - Never proceed to the next step if tests fail—fix or revert first
        - Update checklist and link to new docs/outputs
        - Never lose context between phases
- **Best Practices:**
    - Always link to or update relevant design/vision/strategy docs for each step
    - Break down large tasks into subtasks with clear acceptance criteria
    - Document decisions, blockers, and integration points
    - Maintain modularity, clarity, and traceability throughout
    - Integrate and maintain a simple but effective testing solution (scripts or automated tests) for all core features
    - Testing is a required subtask for each phase—always verify before moving on

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- [x] Embedding proxy service (SentenceTransformers, OpenAI-compatible)
- [x] Vector search pipeline (Neo4j, Qdrant, Graphiti)
- [x] Ingestion, search, and end-to-end testing
- [x] Dockerized services
- [x] Documentation for setup and usage

---

## Phase 2: Unified Model Management & Web Interface
- [ ] Design model catalog API (local + Hugging Face/remote)
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for install/list/switch (embedding & LLM models)
- [ ] Build web UI for model management, testing, and switching
- [ ] Enable shared model storage across containers/projects
- [ ] Document model management features and usage

---

## Phase 3: LLM Integration & Task Routing
- [ ] Integrate local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)
- [ ] Integrate API-based LLMs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- [ ] Implement task router for embedding vs. LLM requests
- [ ] Add prompt engineering and chunking for long docs
- [ ] Extend UI: chat with data, Q&A, rewriting, summarization
- [ ] Document LLM integration and usage patterns

---

## Phase 4: Advanced Features & Multi-Modal Support
- [ ] Build analytics dashboard (usage, resource, trends)
- [ ] Add visualizations (character arcs, entity networks, etc.)
- [ ] Implement multi-modal support (images, audio, etc.)
- [ ] Add notification and automation features
- [ ] Document advanced features and onboarding

---

## Phase 5: Portability & Integration
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria:**
    - Can offload heavy LLM/embedding tasks to a cloud GPU provider (e.g., RunPod, Lambda, AWS, GCP, Paperspace, vast.ai)
    - Secure, configurable, and cost-controlled integration
    - Seamless switching between local and cloud compute as needed
    - Clear documentation and UI for managing cloud resources

## Instructions for New AI Assistants or Team Members
1. **Read this checklist and the strategy/vision docs.**
2. **Pick the first unchecked item in the current phase.**
3. **Review related files and requirements.**
4. **Propose a plan and execute the next step.**
5. **Update this checklist and add notes/links as you go.**
