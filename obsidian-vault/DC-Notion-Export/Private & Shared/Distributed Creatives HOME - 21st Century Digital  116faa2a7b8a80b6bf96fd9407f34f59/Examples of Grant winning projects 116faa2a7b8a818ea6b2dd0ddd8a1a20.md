    ### About
    
    Modular Crypto is a leading media organization dedicated to producing 
    trustworthy, insightful, and accessible content about crypto, with a 
    primary focus on the Portuguese-speaking audience. Our mission is to 
    empower individuals by providing high-quality educational content that 
    guides them on their journey into the decentralized world of Web3. 
    Through our content & events, we aim to break down the complexities 
    of blockchain, making it understandable and engaging for our audience.
    
    Our segments include:
    
    - The State of Ethereum: A weekly show where we analyze the latest
    updates from the Ethereum ecosystem, including network upgrades, Layer 2 solutions, roadmap, staking distribution, and other Ethereum-related
    topics.
    - The State of DeFi: A show that explores decentralized finance (DeFi)
    protocols, covering updates and developments in the broader
    decentralized ecosystem.
    - Modular News / Degen Lunch: A daily audio podcast that brings the
    latest news and updates from across the Web3 ecosystem, keeping
    listeners informed Monday through Friday.
    - Newsletter and Articles: Published twice a week, our newsletters
    cover a wide array of Web3 topics, providing readers with the latest
    developments and insights in the crypto space.
    
    With over 4,000 newsletter subscribers and 8,000 monthly podcast 
    listeners, Modular Crypto has quickly become a trusted resource for the 
    community.
    
    - Events: In 2024, we’re hosting several events across Brazil through
    our "Modular House" initiative, which is aimed at fostering local crypto communities and accelerating crypto adoption nationwide. These events
    will culminate in a major crypto event planned for March 2025.
    
    Our Impact:
    
    Modular Crypto is playing a vital role in advancing the adoption of 
    Web3 in Brazil by making crypto education accessible to Portuguese 
    speakers. In a space where English often dominates, we provide essential
     resources in Portuguese, helping break down language barriers and 
    ensuring more people can engage with the world of blockchain and 
    decentralization.
    
    In just over a year, we’ve produced more than 500 podcast episodes 
    and 60 articles, all of which are freely available. We create daily 
    content (Monday to Friday) in Portuguese, covering news, interviews, and
     deep dives into critical Web3 topics. Our platform serves as a go-to 
    resource for thousands of individuals looking to understand and navigate
     the crypto ecosystem.
    
    Additionally, we've organized over five free events across Brazil, 
    reaching different regions to promote crypto adoption at the grassroots 
    level.
    
    By combining our media initiatives with hands-on events, Modular 
    Crypto is driving both education and adoption in Brazil, making crypto 
    more accessible and fostering a stronger, decentralized future for the 
    country.

    Modular
     Crypto contributes to the growth and development of the Octant 
    ecosystem by creating educational resources and media content that are 
    freely accessible to the Portuguese-speaking community. Our daily 
    content, including podcasts, articles, and newsletters, helps break down
     complex blockchain concepts, making them understandable and accessible 
    to a broader audience. This aligns with the ethos of public goods by 
    providing valuable knowledge and fostering inclusion without barriers.
    
    Furthermore, by hosting free events across different regions of 
    Brazil, we promote local crypto adoption and community engagement, which
     are essential for the sustainable growth of any ecosystem. Through our 
    focus on education and outreach, we are helping to cultivate an informed
     user base, which in turn strengthens and expands the reach of public 
    goods initiatives in the region.
    
    **How does your project align with the round's focus on community and education within the Octant ecosystem?**
    
    Modular
     Crypto aligns perfectly with the round's focus on community and 
    education within the Octant ecosystem. Our primary mission is to educate
     the Brazilian crypto audience by offering consistent, accessible 
    content in Portuguese through daily podcasts, articles, and newsletters.
     We aim to simplify complex topics such as blockchain, DeFi, and 
    governance, making it easier for users to understand and engage with the
     ecosystem.
    
    Beyond content creation, we strengthen community ties by hosting free
     events throughout Brazil, creating spaces for local developers, 
    enthusiasts, and projects to connect and collaborate. These efforts not 
    only enhance learning but also build meaningful connections within the 
    crypto community, supporting the Octant ecosystem's goal of fostering 
    education and community engagement across diverse regions.
    
    Provide
     a clear roadmap of your project, detailing future milestones and 
    deliverables. How does this demonstrate your commitment to long-term 
    impact and growth within the Octant ecosystem?
    
    For
     over a year, Modular Crypto has been consistently producing daily 
    content for the community in a variety of formats, targeting different 
    audiences within the Web3 space. This includes podcasts, newsletter, 
    articles, interviews, and deep dives into blockchain and DeFi topics. 
    Our commitment to long-term impact and growth is demonstrated by our 
    continued effort to educate and engage the Brazilian crypto community.
    
    Looking ahead, we plan to maintain our weekly schedule of daily 
    Twitter Spaces, YouTube live sessions, and regular newsletter/articles 
    updates, ensuring that our audience remains informed and connected. In 
    addition to content production, we’re actively working on a robust 
    events calendar. We have an event scheduled for October 2024 and are 
    organizing a large-scale crypto event for February 2025.
    
    Our goal for Modular Crypto is to play a pivotal role in the 
    education and growth of the Brazilian crypto ecosystem. By consistently 
    delivering valuable content and organizing impactful events, we aim to 
    empower more individuals and projects within the Octant ecosystem, 
    supporting long-term growth and adoption of decentralized technologies 
    in Brazil.
    
    **Describe your team's expertise and how it contributes to the successful execution of your project.**
    
    Our
     team at Modular Crypto is composed of 10 dedicated members, each 
    focused on key areas such as educational content production, marketing, 
    community management, and strategic partnerships. This structure allows 
    us to deliver consistent, high-quality content and foster Web3 adoption 
    throughout Brazil.
    
    Among the founders, João Kury has over three years of experience in 
    Web3 research and community building, having contributed to projects 
    like Bankless Brasil DAO, Nodle Network, and NounsBR, while also being 
    an Optimism Badgeholder. Matheus Guelfi brings over four years of 
    expertise, with significant contributions to Bankless Brasil DAO and 
    Perfect Pool. Gabriella Mena, a former legal professional turned Web3 
    marketer, has coordinated marketing efforts across DAOs and 
    organizations, helping expand the reach of key blockchain initiatives.
    
    Our team's combined experience and dedication ensure that we can 
    execute our mission of delivering educational content and building a 
    robust community within the Web3 space.
    
    **How
     does your project complement or enhance existing initiatives within the
     Octant ecosystem rather than competing directly against them?**
    
    To
     complement and enhance existing initiatives within the Octant 
    ecosystem, our project addresses a significant gap: the lack of 
    high-quality, accessible content in Portuguese. Many current Web3 
    educational resources are available primarily in English, limiting 
    access to non-English speaking communities, especially in Brazil. By 
    focusing on producing educational materials, podcasts, articles, and 
    community events in Portuguese, we bring valuable and localized content 
    to a largely underserved demographic.
    
    Rather than competing with existing projects, we aim to amplify the 
    public goods ecosystem by broadening its reach and fostering deeper 
    engagement with the Portuguese-speaking audience. Our efforts will 
    introduce more users to the ecosystem, bridge language barriers, and 
    drive adoption, ensuring that the ecosystem resonate with a wider and 
    more diverse community.
    
    Describe
     your approach to community engagement and how you plan to contribute to
     a collaborative and constructive funding environment.
    
    Our
     approach to community engagement goes beyond producing educational 
    content. We are focused on creating opportunities for the Brazilian 
    community within the global Web3 ecosystem. Alongside our daily 
    podcasts, YouTube live streams, and in-person events, we aim to increase
     Brazil’s visibility on the international stage by connecting our 
    audience with global projects and vice versa.
    
    We want to ensure that the Brazilian community has access to 
    opportunities often concentrated elsewhere, such as financial backing, 
    networking, and collaborations with international projects. By bridging 
    the gap between Brazil and the broader ecosystem, we are not only 
    helping our community but also enabling other projects to grow in a more
     collaborative and inclusive environment.
    
    How do you plan to use the funding to maximize your project's ongoing impact within the Octant ecosystem if selected?
    
    If
     selected for funding, our primary focus will be to continue producing 
    high-quality, free content in Portuguese, ensuring that the Brazilian 
    community has ongoing access to education and resources within the Web3 
    ecosystem. This includes maintaining our weekly cadence of podcasts, 
    newsletters, livestreams, and articles, all of which help to make 
    complex blockchain topics more accessible.
    
    A significant portion of the funding will be allocated to supporting 
    the talented team behind Modular Crypto, who are responsible for content
     creation, research, and community engagement. Ensuring that our team 
    remains supported is essential for maintaining the level of quality and 
    consistency that our audience has come to expect.
    
    Additionally, we plan to reintroduce and highlight Octant in our 
    content, just as we have done in the past through our livestreams and 
    other platforms. We will showcase updates, opportunities, and 
    advancements within the Octant ecosystem to further raise awareness and 
    drive engagement.

     ecosystem? How has the community received these? Please share any
