# $MUSELY Tokenomics

**Quantity**

- The $MUSE token would be a fixed amount or deflationary currency (no cap on the amount created with a release schedule) with 0 value to start with. TBD

**Wallet**

- You can use a desktop app or a phone app to create a wallet
- This wallet can be the Chia reference app, the Sage wallet or in the future, the Musely wallet. The keys are interchangeable (can be used on any website)

**Fair access**

- Musely accounts
    - Creating a new account on Musely would give you a little $MUSE
    - Performing certain actions on Musely will earn you $MUSE
- Faucet
    - you can get some with the $MUSE faucet - each day you can request a little (limitation based on IP and cookies and wallet, and limited reward will prevent abuse)
    - If $MUSE increases in value above ___ amount per $MUSE, the faucet will be turned off

**Holding NFTs**

- Anyone can make NFTs on Chia - the Mintr tool will be set up make this as easy as possible. You will be able to make advanced NFTs, unlike what most are used to (composable with multiple assets in a single NFT, Fusion-compatible)
- You need a wallet and some $XCH to make NFTs
- Anyone can buy and sell NFTs peer to peer

**DIDs**

- Anyone can make a DID on Chia with a wallet

**Rewards system**

- NFT collections (associated with a DID) can be registered with Musely
- When someone holds an NFT registered with Musely they can earn $MUSE tokens
- Musely users would log in to the platform to redeem tokens
- Tokens are transferred to the registered wallet only when the user logs into the system

**Price/secondary trading**

- The price of $MUSE is determined by those trading who set asking prices.
- Here is an example of market-determined token pricing and liquidity:

**Community Tokenomics**

- The more people who use Musely and $MUSE and the NFT system, the more value the $MUSE coin is likely to create.
- There will be no money backing the token
- Crypto Twitter shows a good example of how this could work with the $SBX token: https://x.com/search?q=%24SBX&src=typed_query

**Liquidity**

- Set by the market
