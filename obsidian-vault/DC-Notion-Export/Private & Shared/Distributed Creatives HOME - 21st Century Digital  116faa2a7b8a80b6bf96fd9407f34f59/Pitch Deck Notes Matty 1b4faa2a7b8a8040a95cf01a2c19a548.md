I took the format from this pitch deck [https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/](https://guykawasaki.com/the-only-10-slides-you-need-in-your-pitch/)

Notes from grig:

- Tell the story of what brought us together and the problems we needed to solve
    - So many platforms, that no one has time to be on all of them and maintain and grow and audience of fans. even a single platform is too much
    - Global space is too large to grow in - can even make a splash in the ocean, need to grow an audience locally first in order to get momentum for global outreach
- Creators have been defeated by
    - lack of potential income to survive
    - in the shadows of top artists who steal top slots and the lion share of money
    - commercial structure favors money makers
    - works are eventually forgotten, no legacy possible

## Detailed output needs to refined

Title page:¬† company name, plus names and titles, address, email, phone number

I say we add our motto in here as well. I also like the Eye Image. 

Slide 2: Problem/Opportunity

Being creative with a successful working career is a near impossible feat. They have to navigate an endless number of different platforms all with a learning curve and subscription fee. One platform to create, another platform to run memberships, another platform to engage your audience socially, another platform to run your email list, another platform to sell your work and the list goes on and on. This doesn‚Äôt even begin to cover blockchain tech and web3.

A creative is no longer doing their creative work, but paying to run a marketing company for their brand that's the backbone of all these for profit platforms, that are taking a percentage of their earnings.

Slide 3: Value Proposition

Being a creative for some is a choice. For others it‚Äôs an insatiable hunger that can only be tamed through unleashing a force of life that if suppressed will surely lead to madness. Though creativity is beneficial for all humanity. The realms of finance and business are of great value, but without the creatives it would be a dreary dullness of cookie cutter existence, whose taste couldn‚Äôt be made to touch the divine with all the money in the world.

To create a model that empowers the creatives to thrive on their own terms can usher in a new era of economic prosperity as audiences participate in all the collateral businesses directly and indirectly associated with the creative industries.

Slide 4: Underlying Magick (This could be multiple slides since we‚Äôve got so much.)

Says to have more visuals vs words. We have the Musely graphic, LAN Could be an image that somehow captures the flow of it weaving the venues together. CHAIN OF Creators, shows one of the NFT‚Äôs broken down into it‚Äôs various parts. ‚ÄúInfinite remix, provenance and royalties on chain‚Äù, Forever sites. An image that conveys art of today being viewed long into the future.

Let‚Äôs create some flow charts for how the different projects work. A show don‚Äôt tell kind of thing.

A couple sentences for each.

LAN: weaving together local creative communities for a thriving creative economy

Musely: social media for creatives. One app, Your data, Forever free

Chain of Creators: Remix revolution. Provenance and Royalties. All on blockchain.

Forever sites: Preserving humanities cultural legacy for future generations and interplanetary civilizations.

Slide 5 Business Model:

The key revenue drivers will be sponsorship on the LAN ( provide graphic with numbers from Boulder test case. Expand to what multiple cities would like)

Memberships. Roughly $10 a month. 60% of every membership is invested back into the community to support the creatives in the network. This drives membership adoption. (A graphic that shows the cycle of money coming in, going into the community and supporting the development of high quality talent, that then uses the platform)

Our aim is to become the largest membership organization on the planet by creating a global lattice of DC nodes. (can we get this done visually?)

High networth donors. Tax write off, Tickets to events, Impact reports, collectible memorabilia both physical and digital that can be shown off, exclusive VIP experiences through Black Opal Life. Get to live in more vibrant, safe and fun communities.

(we should include some statistics from this page [https://www.notion.so/Statistics-on-working-artists-f32b271991254a29a7ed43692808e4d9?pvs=4](DC%20grants%20HOME%20131faa2a7b8a803892b3db0d504d3b32/Statistics%20on%20working%20artists%20f32b271991254a29a7ed43692808e4d9.md)) 

Like these 
The Arts Industry Contributes Greatly to the GDP
The arts and culture sector contributed approximately $804 billion to the US economy in 2016. The average annual growth of the arts and culture sector is 4.2%, as of that time. Independent artists, writers, and performers contributed $22 billion to the US economy in 2016.

 ‚ÄîNational Endowment for the Arts Annual Report (2017); The U.S. Arts and Cultural Production Satellite Account, National Endowment for the Arts (2016)

Commercial Arts Activity Generates $ for Urban Economies
According to research conducted by the New York‚Äìbased organizations Alliance for the Arts and R.Dot, nonprofit and commercial arts activity ‚Äúgenerates $17.7 billion annually for the Big Apple.‚Äù ‚ÄîProject for Public Spaces, How Art Economically Benefits Cities (2008)

Rural Area Arts Industry Brings in Money from Out-of-State
‚ÄúThe arts are often overlooked when states are focusing on economic development,‚Äù but data shows that the arts sector contributes greatly to the economy. Though no comprehensive state-level research exists, a Montana study shows that the arts had an economic impact of $233 million, with 77% of goods sold to out-of-state buyers. ‚ÄîMontana State University, The Economic Impact of Montana
Artists (2005)

This is to showcase that by supporting this project that‚Äôs a non-profit can support the bottom line of their other investments because the arts boost the rest of the economy.

Slide 6: Go to Market Plan

We take over Boulder. 181k target market, guerilla art in the streets, relationships with venues established, LAN in venues, Ads in local papers, Partnering with all the local cultural organizations. Perfect the model here then expand to rest of state, national globe. Co-Founder been in town for 13 years networking and organizing local art community.

Digital infrastructure scaled like uber, Facebook, AirBnB. They perfected the model in a specific market then scaled the globe quickly because it didn‚Äôt have centralized brick and mortar needs. It was a framework with a digital backbone.

Slide 7: Competitive Analysis

Musely slide here showing all the orgs we‚Äôre going to out compete as a non-profit. For other projects I‚Äôm not totally sure what these are. I feel like except for the LAN they‚Äôre kind of like be features of Musely.

For this slide I think we say the number of apps that Grig researched and made a spreadsheet of that goes along with the slide. Show that is a fractured competitive field that creators have to spend money for all the different subscriptions  and none of them serve the needs of both creatives and the audience.

Slide 8: Management

Just show our beautiful rad team and all the magick we‚Äôve done with collectively over 100 years of experience in creative culture and tech.

Slide 9: Financial Projections and Key Metrics

Use graphics of 3 years of projected revenue from LAN, Memberships and Donors.

Key metrics. Number of venues with LAN displays, Boulder has 181k market 5% members is 9,050. Goal is to have that in 2 years. 3k gets us sustainable.

Slide 10: Current Status, Accomplishments, Use of Funds

Initial products will be ready for initial market launch this summer.

Within 6 months of deciding to found project. 501c3 secured, board established, secured initial funding to bring product to market

Breakdown of where we are going to be extremely responsible and make it go a long way.
