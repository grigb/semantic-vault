## February 21, 2025

Attendees: Ron @ Trainspot.ai, Grig

https://fathom.video/share/c6B4KgX5xGz33Ea_qQnUGzWnN7zj1X8x

### üì£¬†Agenda

## OPENING (2-3 minutes)

"Hey Ron, thanks so much for making time to talk today. I know David through my work at Laszlo Systems, and I was really excited when I learned about what you're building at Trainspot. I run Distributed Creatives, which is a nonprofit focused on preserving digital creative work, and I think there's a perfect opportunity for us to work together on something pretty important.

I'd love to start by hearing your thoughts on how the creator data marketplace is developing at Trainspot, and then I can share how I think Forever Sites could fit into that picture."

[Pause for response]

## THE PROBLEM (5 minutes)

"Let me share what we're working on at Forever Sites. We're tackling a huge problem in the digital world that I think directly relates to what you're building. Every day, we're seeing valuable digital content disappear for all sorts of reasons. Sure, platforms shut down or pivot ‚Äì but there's actually a much bigger issue at play.

We're seeing estate executors who inherit responsibility for someone's digital legacy but don't have the technical knowledge to maintain it. We're watching collections vanish when funding runs out or when there's no clear succession plan. Remember when Geocities disappeared and took 38 million websites with it? That's the kind of mass extinction event we're trying to prevent.

As a nonprofit, we're in a unique position to address this. Every bit of funding and revenue we generate goes right back into improving our preservation infrastructure and tools. We're building this as a public good, which means we can focus entirely on serving creators and preserving their work, rather than maximizing profit."

## OUR SOLUTION (5-7 minutes)

"What makes our approach different from traditional preservation efforts is that instead of trying to preserve finished products like websites or PDFs, we work with creators to capture their content as structured JSON data right from the source. Think of it as preserving the DNA of the content rather than just taking a snapshot.

We've built a complete suite of web3 tools around this. Every piece of content comes with built-in licensing terms and royalty structures, all managed through smart contracts. We use DIDs and verifiable credentials to ensure authenticity and provenance. This means when someone accesses content through our system, they know exactly where it came from and that it's legitimate.

Because we're a nonprofit, all of these tools are open source and available as a public good. We believe this kind of infrastructure should belong to everyone, not be locked away in proprietary systems."

## VALUE PROPOSITION FOR TRAINSPOT (5 minutes)

"Here's where I think it gets really interesting for Trainspot. We're essentially creating pristine training data from the start. Everything's structured, verified, and connected with clear provenance. And because we're capturing it as JSON data rather than final presentation format, it's already optimized for machine processing.

I really appreciate how Trainspot is focused on ensuring creators get properly compensated for their contributions to AI training. Our smart contracts could integrate with your payment systems to automate this process, ensuring creators get paid whenever their work is used while maintaining transparent records of everything.

We could create a really smooth pipeline ‚Äì creators onboard their content through our process, with the option to make it available on Trainspot with just a click. You get access to high-quality, verified training data with clear rights management, and creators get a streamlined way to participate in the AI economy."

## FUNDING AND PARTNERSHIP OPPORTUNITIES (5 minutes)

"As a nonprofit, we're always looking for ways to expand our impact through partnerships and funding opportunities. We're currently working on several grant proposals focused on digital preservation and AI-ready data. Having partners like Trainspot would really strengthen these proposals.

We're also building partnerships with other permanent storage providers and preservation-focused organizations to create a more robust ecosystem. If there are opportunities for joint funding initiatives or ways we could collaborate on grant proposals, we'd be very interested in exploring those.

All the proceeds from any collaboration would go directly back into improving our infrastructure and tools, which in turn would help provide better quality data for platforms like Trainspot. We see this as a virtuous cycle where commercial partnerships help fund better preservation tools, which then create better training data for AI companies."

## EXPLORATION AND FEEDBACK (5 minutes)

"Before we get too far ahead though, I'd love to hear your thoughts on this. What types of content and metadata are most valuable for your marketplace? Are there specific quality metrics we should be considering in our onboarding process? I'd also be really interested in getting the technical specifications for connecting with the Trainspot platform ‚Äì that would help us ensure our data structure aligns perfectly with your needs."

[Pause for discussion]

## NEXT STEPS (3-5 minutes)

"If this resonates with you, I'd love to explore how we might structure a collaboration. We could start by looking at the technical integration points, maybe do a small pilot to demonstrate the value. And since we're a nonprofit, we're very flexible in how we structure partnerships - we're focused on impact rather than profit. What aspects of this would you want to prioritize?"

## December 23, 2024

Attendees: 

### üì£¬†Agenda

- Expediting 501c3
    
    you can request expedited processing of your Form 1023 application for 501(c)(3) status. The IRS offers this through Form 8940 "Request for Miscellaneous Determination." However, you'll need to demonstrate a compelling reason, such as:
    
    1. A pending grant that's substantial relative to your organization's budget
    2. A good faith error led to missing an IRS deadline
    3. Your organization must take immediate action for a newly enacted state or federal deadline
    
    The expedite request requires:
    
    - Clear explanation of the need for expedited handling
    - Supporting documentation (e.g., grant letter with deadline)
    - Information showing significant hardship if expedited processing is denied
    
    Note that not all requests are granted, and the IRS grants expedited processing only in true emergencies. If approved, this can reduce processing time significantly, though exact timeframes vary.
    
- Setting up staffing page
    1. I think what we need to start thinking about is working groups for the different projects and disciplines.
    For example, a team of devs for just music, that builds tools for musicians. They would work out ways to allow artists to sell music on the site with playback and comments like SoundCloud. They would provide grants for albums and even provide $ for funding gigs and vinyl pressings.
    Another team would focus on film, poetry, fine art scene integration, etc.
    Then there's the whole world of web3, and supporting the Forever Sites vision, minting cross-chain, fractional ownership, etc.
    The more of this we have thought out, the sooner we can find volunteers who could become paid staff.
    2. If we can understand what we want for web3, we can start asking folks at the blockchain meetups and get people to join us to build the tools.
- Choosing a different meeting day/time
    - The current one conflicts with the Boulder Blockchain meeting on the first Tuesday of every month
- Musely.social

        organizing document.
            
            For each past, present, or planned activity, include information that answers the following questions:
            
            a. What is the activity
            - Providing resources, funding, and platforms for creatives and artists to showcase and develop their work.
            b. Who conducts the activity
            - Conducted by the organization's staff, including the President ~~Grigory Bilham~~, board members, and volunteers.
            c. Where is the activity conducted
            - Primarily in Boulder, Colorado, with plans to expand via online platforms.
            d. When is the activity conducted
            - Ongoing, with events and programs scheduled throughout the year.
            e. How does the activity further your exempt purposes
            - By supporting artists, we promote cultural enrichment and education, aligning with our charitable and educational purposes under section 501(c)(3).
            f. Percentage of time allocated:
            - 70
            
        - Do you or will you publish, own, or have rights in music, literature, tapes, artworks, choreography, scientific discoveries, or other intellectual property? If 'Yes,' describe who owns or will own any copyrights, patents, or trademarks, whether fees are or will be charged, how the fees are determined, and how any items are or will be produced, distributed, and marketed.
            - All copyrights for music, literature, and other artistic works created or funded through nonprofit projects may be held by the nonprofit organization itself, Distributed Creatives.     Fees for licensing or access to these works will be determined based on the production costs, market value, and the intended audience (e.g., public educational use may be discounted or offered for free, while commercial use may incur licensing fees). The nonprofit will establish a fee schedule that prioritizes accessibility for artists, educators, and community members while still generating funds to support ongoing operations and programs.    Works will be distributed primarily through the nonprofit's website, social media channels, and partner platforms. The organization may also distribute physical copies or limited editions in cases where tangible items enhance reach and engagement with the community. Marketing will focus on building a creative network, leveraging partnerships with others.
        - 9. Do you or will you make grants, loans, or other distributions to organizations? If "Yes," describe the type and purpose of the grants, loans, or distributions, how you select your recipients including submission requirements (such as grant proposals or application forms), and the criteria you use or will use to select recipients. Also describe how you ensure the grants, loans, and other distributions are or will be used for their intended purposes (including whether you require periodic or final reports on the use of funds and any procedures you have if you identify that funds are not being used for their intended purposes). Finally, describe the records you keep with respect to grants, loans, or other distributions you make and identify any recipient organizations and any relationships between you and the recipients. If "No," continue to Line
            - Distributed Creatives provides grants to support creative projects, community impact initiatives, and professional development for artists. Grants are awarded based on artistic merit, community benefit, feasibility, and commitment to diversity. Recipients sign an agreement outlining fund use and submit progress and final reports to ensure accountability. Larger grants may include site visits or virtual check-ins.  Funds are tracked through a secure database containing all application details, recipient information, and financial records. Progress and final reports are archived, enabling the nonprofit to assess project impact and maintain transparency in its support of the arts community.

            Distributed Creatives may engage in fundraising activities to support other arts and creative organizations focused on grant-making for creators. While specific arrangements are still in development, the goal is to collaborate with like-minded organizations to increase funding opportunities for artists. These partnerships will align with our mission to expand resources within the creative community, leveraging shared fundraising efforts to amplify impact.

- Creating a for profit entity?
    - investors, donations, revenue
        
        ### Donations:
        
        - **Donations** are the primary funding source for most nonprofits.
        - Donations are tax-deductible for donors if your nonprofit has **501(c)(3)** status.
        - The funds must be used for activities aligned with your nonprofit‚Äôs mission.
        
        ### Investments:
        
        Nonprofits can accept **investments**, but it depends on the type of investment and the structure of the nonprofit. Here are the key considerations:
        
        ### 1. **Program-Related Investments (PRIs):**
        
        - These are investments made by individuals or organizations (often foundations) to advance a nonprofit‚Äôs mission.
        - PRIs are treated as investments rather than donations, but they must primarily serve charitable purposes.
        - Returns on PRIs are often below-market rates.
        
        ### 2. **For-Profit Subsidiaries:**
        
        - If the nonprofit wants to accept equity investments or generate profit that is not mission-related, it can create a **for-profit subsidiary**.
        - Investors provide capital to the for-profit entity, and the profits can be reinvested into the nonprofit.
        
        ### 3. **Debt Financing:**
        
        - Nonprofits can issue debt, such as bonds or loans, as a form of investment.
        - Investors receive a return on their investment, typically in the form of interest payments.
        - This is common in sectors like affordable housing.
        
        ### 4. **Social Impact Investing:**
        
        - Some investors provide funds to nonprofits expecting a return based on the social impact of the organization's activities.
        - This can include loans, equity stakes in social enterprises, or other structured investments.
        
        ### Legal and Operational Considerations:
        
        1. **Compliance with Tax-Exempt Status:**
            - Any investment activity must align with the nonprofit's mission and cannot result in private benefit or excessive profit-sharing with investors.
            - If unrelated business income (UBI) is generated, the nonprofit may owe **Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT)**.
        2. **Clear Agreements:**
            - Clearly define the terms of the investment, including return expectations, timeframes, and the use of funds.
        3. **Transparency and Reporting:**
            - Nonprofits must ensure accurate financial reporting and transparency with both donors and investors.
        4. **Board Approval:**
            - The board of directors should approve any investment agreements and ensure they align with the organization‚Äôs mission and bylaws.
        
        ### **Revenue Generation**
        
        As a nonprofit, earning revenue is entirely legal as long as it supports your mission. In your case:
        
        - **Selling Ads: (Call it a sponsor - does this make it clear)**
            
            You can sell ads on your digital signage, but this might qualify as **Unrelated Business Income (UBI)** if the ads don't directly relate to your nonprofit‚Äôs charitable purpose. UBI is taxable under the IRS's **Unrelated Business Income Tax (UBIT)** rules.
            
        - **Selling Tickets:**
            
            Selling tickets for events or experiences that align with your mission (e.g., art exhibitions, creator showcases) is generally **mission-related income** and not subject to UBIT.
            
        - **Other Revenue Streams:**
            
            Revenue from mission-aligned activities (e.g., promoting creators' work, selling art, or educational workshops) is permissible and tax-exempt.
            
        
        ### **Options for Working with Investors**
        
        If you want to offer a return on investment, you could consider these approaches:
        
        ### 1. **Create a For-Profit Subsidiary**
        
        - A separate for-profit company could handle the ad sales, ticket sales, and other revenue-generating activities.
        - The for-profit entity can issue dividends to investors while funneling profits back to the nonprofit as donations or grants.
        - This structure keeps the nonprofit compliant while leveraging the for-profit's flexibility.
        
        ### 2. **Program-Related Investments (PRIs)**
        
        - Investors can provide funds as **low-interest loans** or equity-like investments with returns based on social impact rather than profit.
        - PRIs must align with your mission and provide below-market financial returns.
        
        ### 3. **Social Enterprise Model**
        
        - Run revenue-generating activities directly within the nonprofit as a **social enterprise**, but do not distribute profits.
        - Instead, reinvest the earnings into the nonprofit's programs.
        
        ### 4. **Revenue Sharing Without Dividends**
        
        - Partner with creators, venues, or other stakeholders through profit-sharing agreements that allocate a portion of the revenue to them while keeping your nonprofit's mission intact.

    Heidi, Matty, Grig, and Dr. discussed the foundation of their organization, focusing on its unique approach and the potential of new technologies. They considered setting up in a different state, with Wyoming and Colorado being the main options. Heidi shared her experience with Wyoming's faster and more secure LLC process, while Dr. mentioned that their 501(c)(3) process in Colorado takes about 3 to 7 days. The team agreed to further explore these options and potentially work together to expedite the process.
    
    **Nonprofit Organizations and Compliance Discussion**
    Dr. and Heidi discussed the differences between 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) nonprofit organizations, with the former able to receive tax-deductible donations and the latter not. They also discussed setting up a 501(c)(3) nonprofit focused on supporting creative culture and the need to comply with Colorado's regulations around administrative costs. The team also discussed the status of their entity, which is registered as a nonprofit corporation in Colorado, and the possibility of setting up a sister company as an LLC for financial purposes. The conversation concluded with a discussion on the distinction between two nonprofit corporations, one being a social welfare organization and the other a tax-exempt nonprofit.
    
    **Exploring Digital Signage, Tipping System, and Non-Profit Models**
    Grig discussed setting up digital signage to promote art and stream events, along with a digital tipping system and Patreon subscription model. They explored using blockchain technology and forming an LLC for Electric Avenue, a solar charging station. Heidi and Dr. suggested creating a non-profit organization to benefit from the technology without funding its development. The team considered building the technology as a non-profit, seeking funding from contributors, and potentially using a public benefit corporation model. They discussed an open-source experience allowing multiple entities to utilize the technology. Matty proposed a non-profit model giving 100% profits to artists, similar to community radio memberships supporting artists. The team aimed to develop a model financing their tech company while supporting artists.
    
    **Exploring New Legal Entity and Funding Strategies**
    Grig expressed interest in exploring a new legal entity and sought advice from Heidi and Dr. on how to proceed. The team discussed the potential for securing funding and the strategy of starting small in a niche market before scaling up. They agreed on the need to define use cases for different stakeholders and create engaging micro-use cases to inspire key stakeholders to join their community. The team also discussed the development of a local artist network and digital signage project, with Matty emphasizing the need for a platform that supports artists. Grig shared that they are working on a website and have a list of stakeholders for each project, and are considering starting the project with their own money. Heidi agreed with this approach, and Matty suggested having a low-cost initial win with the digital signage and a snappy pitch deck to attract funding. Dr. suggested applying for pilot study grants to fund the initial stages of the project. The team agreed on the need for a pilot study to demonstrate the effectiveness of the project.
    
    **Exploring Fiscal Sponsorship and Grant Opportunities**
    The team discussed the concept of a fiscal sponsor and its implications for their organization. They explored the possibility of their organization being a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC) and partnering with a 501(c)(3) entity. The team also discussed government grants, with one member sharing their experience of securing a grant for a needs assessment pilot study. The conversation ended with the team considering the potential benefits of being a PBC and partnering with a 501(c)(3) entity for grant opportunities. Heidi and Dr. discussed the process of submitting grant applications, emphasizing the importance of aligning with the funding agency's goals and demonstrating capability to manage the grants. The team also discussed the potential benefits of strong partnerships and a well-thought-out plan when applying for grants.
    
    **Exploring AI for Administrative Work and Grants**
    Matty, Heidi, and Dr. discussed the potential of using AI for administrative work, specifically for note-taking and grant submissions. Dr. suggested utilizing AI to write notes for the meeting and to find grants, which would then be rewritten based on the AI's information. Heidi shared her method of using AI in grant writing, emphasizing the importance of passion and drive in the writing. The team also discussed potential partnerships and funding opportunities for their project, considering reaching out to the Chamber of Commerce and local city councils for support. They agreed on the need for a user-friendly platform that aligns with the community's needs and fosters mass adoption.

    00;00;00;00 - 00;00;36;07
    Unknown
    Okay, so just forget that's there. So, where do we begin? So, yeah, the digital signage land thing. Like, every time I think about it, it turns it, it's really the, the crucial thing that we're working beyond the website and the published manifesto, white paper roadmap. It's really the way we can prove that we know how to manifest something and actually do something in reality, and not just a bunch of hot air.
    
    00;00;36;09 - 00;01;26;06
    Unknown
    Yup. Which is important. Yup. And so I think that's like a really crucial part of it. I also think, and I've just been kind of, you know, thought about it on the way here and while you were on your, recording session, and I keep thinking the same thing. So that's typically means something to me, but, that the the concept of a, the distributed creatives, variety show or whatever you want to call it, makes a lot of sense to and, transforming your broadcast thing into something that there's enough money behind it to get the better version of the streaming software so we can engage with the
    
    00;01;26;06 - 00;01;53;03
    Unknown
    community properly so that we can, really take advantage of the web2 stuff that people are making a career off of these days. When you're like a youth, could be a YouTube YouTube channel. And also with AI being able to have that up. So all of a sudden like that has like massive amounts of clips to be basically, I'd say like there's probably around $100 a month in software that we would be if we had that, like maybe a little more, but yeah.
    
    00;01;53;03 - 00;02;17;21
    Unknown
    Yeah. You know, it was just a rough estimate. But all of a sudden we'd be able to be able to stream across people to stream across all social media channels. Yeah. And edit it into being shareable content that's like bite sized and like very. And it'd be all super low key. So all of a sudden our socials would be able to really start to ramp up, and, and start to build our footprint.
    
    00;02;17;23 - 00;02;47;19
    Unknown
    Yeah. Yeah. And I feel like the studio space would be perfect for that. I think so, and it's also a concept I've thought about for a long time. Yeah. You know, and I think there will be a lot of people that would be excited about it. And, you know, if we had like, that's where I think that part of that to have like saying, like getting like fundraising like 20 K that would be enough to really so that we can do that, start to be able to organize things and be able to do this work on this project full time enough, where we could organize it and, you know, send out the emails and
    
    00;02;47;19 - 00;03;17;14
    Unknown
    like, get the coordinate, the pieces. Yeah. Yeah, I agree. And, yeah, we really want to know what that number is or the burn rate for a successful, endeavor. And just, just in terms of, you know, starting to broadcast and then getting it onto YouTube and having a repeating variety show concept. I think it could be great.
    
    00;03;17;14 - 00;03;43;02
    Unknown
    And, using the, distributed creatives name as the sort of banner for the whole thing, so that the name is great. You know, I've searched for it and you just get all these white papers on the concepts, which is a good sign. Yeah. And we really want to, it just explains what the whole idea is so quickly.
    
    00;03;43;04 - 00;04;12;06
    Unknown
    And just having that and bringing in, you know, structuring an hour or so that you've got a five minute intro or a five minute outro, you've got 50 minutes of content in between, which can be, connecting to people in the room with you or we can do, you know, live streams from different locations, or we can do, like an interview, where we talk to the person and then we play their prerecorded chunk of media.
    
    00;04;12;08 - 00;04;43;18
    Unknown
    And, you know, reach out to fairly unrepresented communities, like, I mean, everyone's got a somewhat some representation these days, but, like, reaching out to the metaverse groups and saying, look, know you can come on our live broadcast show and talk about your metaverse project. Yeah. Or like, and that's just a, that's an edge case. But I find the edge cases interesting because you can get cultural significance in a smaller pond.
    
    00;04;43;18 - 00;05;08;01
    Unknown
    Yeah. Well, and also getting that culture, I feel like that's part of why I feel like Boulder is the similar methodology of, like, launching this instead of like going to LA or New York or some major city and being like, we're going to launch it there. Like, you might be able to get like a little bit of like a thread in, but like, we're somewhere like here, the smaller pond, you can really make a much larger effect that makes everybody really see what's happening.
    
    00;05;08;02 - 00;05;52;20
    Unknown
    So then once they understand that and like how it's networking, and then you can translate it to a larger pond. Yeah. And some of the like the digging ourselves out of barely paying rent to like surviving and maybe even thriving. I think that path, we can kind of do some of that, like some of the things that we design, like the land, look at local artists network, needs software behind it, and I'm willing to, to work on that, you know, but if we get funding, we can turn those into, things that we can resell.
    
    00;05;52;22 - 00;06;16;27
    Unknown
    And, like, we'll be kind of like designing the things we need, building them for ourselves and then creating this, like, suite of products. Exactly. And. Exactly. Yeah. And I've read that, though I included the in the roadmap, I think the mender like in, in the white paper, I think maybe a little bit more robust, but yeah, I've been thinking a lot about that as like, even though, like traditionally people think about a nonprofit, like they're only, like taking money.
    
    00;06;16;27 - 00;06;38;24
    Unknown
    They're not actually like selling a service, but like, there's no reason I pretty sure there's no reason why you can't sell a service. Just the the money of that service just can't go towards paying for profit. Right. I mean, it just goes back into supporting the business, which were the OP or the organization which includes paying the staff.
    
    00;06;38;27 - 00;07;02;18
    Unknown
    I believe if we do it properly and we have a really beautiful suite of tools that we can be making a lot of money as an organization. Yeah. And members, I think I even ran the numbers for Boulder and it's included in the white paper. But you know, like I there's like I think total roughly like total addressable market in Boulder County is like 100 and like 80,000.
    
    00;07;02;20 - 00;07;24;12
    Unknown
    And, you know, I was at the like a low, low ball versus like a high ball, like representation, like let's we had like, 30% like whatever. And then like a percentage of those that are members. Like, it's very quickly gets to be like 10,000 to 100,000, like a month. Yeah. With just getting like 10% of like, you know, ten, you know.
    
    00;07;24;15 - 00;07;53;13
    Unknown
    And so, so yeah, there's a business model there. Yeah. And also the by having the product out there and like networking in Boulder, or like yes. That I think and the size of Boulder that we can really attract that. You know my I think the first year I was kind of my goal was to get like attract like 30% of that total addressable market that is like not members but are like actively participating in the ecosystem using the tools for free.
    
    00;07;53;14 - 00;08;18;05
    Unknown
    Right. And then like, you know, maybe ten. And I was like, get a 10%, 20% and like 30% met paying membership on that. Yeah. And, you know, I always think, it's best to offer as much of that stuff for free as possible early on. And then find the right model for it after. It's like, clearly something people want.
    
    00;08;18;05 - 00;08;45;14
    Unknown
    And you find what I feel like the artist like how I felt is that like the tools themselves are for free. It's more like the, the businesses. Right. That would be and like but and since we're a nonprofit, we can offer them at like a really like figure out like that price point. But since we're not a like our main thing is going to be memberships and like encouraging tipping because we're not making a profit on it.
    
    00;08;45;16 - 00;09;06;06
    Unknown
    And artists voluntarily being like, oh yeah, I'll, I'll give you guys 3% or whatever because they see what we're doing. Yeah. And all of that's like that's for me. What will create the stickiness and what people gets people excited to like, contribute to it is because like, oh wow, look what they're doing. Like they just sponsored like five concerts in Boulder that month.
    
    00;09;06;06 - 00;09;24;27
    Unknown
    And all of those artists got paid and they didn't have to think about, like, all of the, like the marketing and all that stuff. And so the tools then work and then why a business would be willing to do it is because we've got a large, active audience who are then all of a sudden those nights that were kind of slow, they don't like, you know, the sudden there aren't any more slow nights, right?
    
    00;09;24;28 - 00;09;44;16
    Unknown
    Selling their drinks and like, all the things. Right. And we come in and just fill fill it. Yes. I think we're on the same page. I just, I know as a struggling artist that I won't have the, the I won't be able to commit to yet another subscription, but like, let's, let's skip over that for a second. Yeah.
    
    00;09;44;16 - 00;10;13;20
    Unknown
    What what I really wanted to get to was, we build these tools and the, distributed, creatives. If you're part of that or you're you're we we use those tools for free. You get as an artist, you get on the the show. Yep. And, that show does all of the, like, streaming to these, the, the land digital signage points and,
    
    00;10;13;22 - 00;10;31;22
    Unknown
    Oh, okay. Yeah, I see now I see why you the how it ties into all of that. Right. And so like in the back end, the digital signage thing is this piece of software that will be developed in like, you have a front end, you'll be able to go to the website and, and watch streams from there, or you'll be able to put it up on your TV at your coffee shop.
    
    00;10;31;24 - 00;11;03;19
    Unknown
    You'll be able to if you're, contributing to the network as, a performance location, you'll be able to, advertise the shows that are about to happen. And, like, let me just paint one vision that I had that is a reoccurring vision of how this could work, where like, if we had, you know, we start with the riverside and, the junkyard, and maybe one other similar vibe in place, you know, roughly 100 person occupancy.
    
    00;11;03;19 - 00;11;36;03
    Unknown
    Occupancy, each one of those with, our digital signage, which is a roughly 55 inch TV, in a prominent location inside the inside the building, and, the vision is that you could, you could using just your bike, you know, travel between these locations in Boulder, and go and attend it, maybe even have a, single ticket for the whole network.
    
    00;11;36;05 - 00;11;57;20
    Unknown
    And, and then, you know, you start off at the Riverside and, there's a scheduled event and you're in the, in the event space with the live audience. And it's you can see the broadcast on the digital signage in the corner of the event you're at. And at the bottom there's a ticker thing. It's saying in two hours time, come see, blah, blah, blah at such and such.
    
    00;11;57;22 - 00;12;20;27
    Unknown
    And when that event starts with that space, everybody collectively gets in their cars or bikes or walks to the next circuit, start a Thursday because Thursdays there's a huge bike thing in Boulder, right? And so there could be we could tie the initial ones into something like that. Yeah. But I love this I think so, yeah. Like what I want to do is create this sort of thriving.
    
    00;12;20;27 - 00;12;50;08
    Unknown
    Yeah. Creative ecosystem. So you go to the next location and, you know, ideally you're not driving. So, hey, maybe have a beer with your buddies at the next location and you're watching the next event. And, you're just kind of part of this, like, creative environment the whole time. Yeah. And ideally it would happen, you know, every weekend, like, so every weekend, if you are into this, you, know, what you're doing with your time.
    
    00;12;50;08 - 00;13;11;19
    Unknown
    You're, you're basically coffee shop hopping or bar hopping or whatever you want to call it between these locations where the events are. And if you don't want to, move, if you're happy where you are, you can watch the show from the from your location as as it's streamed from the the one that's playing that the next event.
    
    00;13;11;19 - 00;13;43;22
    Unknown
    Right. So you can basically live this sort of creative, community lifestyle in such a way where your, you just know what you're doing with your, your weekends. Right? So that's part of it. And, the idea is obviously that you can get you can get this sort of mass crowd together, that kind of like a descends on a spot, like a, swarm of locusts and, buys out all the coffee and beer and then, like, goes off to the next location.
    
    00;13;43;22 - 00;14;02;28
    Unknown
    And each one of these locations can enjoy the fruits of each other's, networking. Yeah. And if we're able to have us as the sponsors that bring in enough money, you mean that we can. We're figuring out, like, the ticket cost and effectiveness for the artists and stuff so that they get paid to for what they're doing? Yeah.
    
    00;14;02;28 - 00;14;22;22
    Unknown
    Oh, yeah. No, the the whole idea is like when someone got this thing about, like, ticket costs and, like, right, to get people to be motivated to go in and be like, you know, well, yeah, if you pay like, you know, 20 bucks for it, maybe it's, 80% of the cost if you paid for each one separately to go to all of them.
    
    00;14;22;22 - 00;14;44;03
    Unknown
    Yeah, something like that. Yeah. Yeah. So we can play with the numbers and fit in there. But the idea would be, you know, that, you're creating this, like, network, just thinking of the consumer. First person who's trying to have a good time. Yeah, yeah. And then obviously from that comes this amazing opportunity for all the artists.
    
    00;14;44;03 - 00;15;14;24
    Unknown
    Yeah. And, so you start but you, you kind of tie in the, and clearly you would be broadcasting these things, turning them into YouTube, things that can bring in revenue as well. Yeah. You create this whole like, ecosystem of events and it's basically the variety show concept where it's poetry, it's live music. It's, people showing off their, latest movies.
    
    00;15;14;24 - 00;15;30;28
    Unknown
    Yeah. I love it. I even like, you know, the word Sundance is possible. I know I voted yes, I, I voted very clearly. I was like, we want to you. Yeah. So, like, if we could get this digital signage up before Sundance shows up and it's not going to be like till 2027, that's fine. We have plenty of time.
    
    00;15;30;29 - 00;15;51;04
    Unknown
    Yeah, well, we're going to do that in the year. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. 100% on board. I've had very similar visions. Okay. I just wanted to get that out there. Yeah, yeah. No I'm like 100% on board. That's exactly the kind of when I'm talking about creating a digital infrastructure that overlays the the art, like local art economy. It's exactly what I'm talking about.
    
    00;15;51;04 - 00;16;15;03
    Unknown
    Right? Basically how I see it is like if we have 30% of saturation of users on like, let's whatever that's like out of 180,000 people. Yeah. Like it's like that one student in town. Yeah, yeah. Well yeah. Yeah. Because they, they add a lot to it. Yeah. There's 37,000 of them. Are students okay. And that might that's I think that might even be Boulder County.
    
    00;16;15;06 - 00;16;43;16
    Unknown
    I think roughly like but this that's like total like those are our target market. I think like Boulder itself, is like I have the numbers, but it's like 70,000 or whatever. You know what? It's but it's still like, let's say like 20% of that. Like, if we get, like three even, let's just say like, forget about all those numbers, but like 3000 people, like, actively engaged in this platform that are going to all the different venues around Boulder.
    
    00;16;43;18 - 00;17;11;27
    Unknown
    Boulder has one venue that can fit a thousand people, right? Every other venues like capacity like 2 or 300 people. Right? So if there's 3000 people that are actively engaging in events around Boulder, every venue is going to be sold out. Yeah. Well that's great, right? Yeah. I mean, I'm assuming, yeah. You mentioned the 1000 capacity issue before we talked about, you know, maybe engaging with the campus, which has, the Mach-E, Mach-E.
    
    00;17;11;27 - 00;17;32;07
    Unknown
    And I think that one is another, like I think that's the other venue that is like, I'm not sure what it is, but it's definitely 1000 person plus. Yeah. So we can grow into these other spaces. But yeah, I would assume, you know, grassroots efforts, something like that. You don't want really large capacity like you know, with. Yeah.
    
    00;17;32;07 - 00;17;49;04
    Unknown
    Well, I mean, I was talking to a guy who was about, he was like maybe in his 60s or whatever, but he was talking about the New York scene and everything, and like, part of how they made these places to be like the IT scene was, they chose venues that were like, they were intentionally small. Yeah. So that there's like a huge audience.
    
    00;17;49;04 - 00;18;05;18
    Unknown
    There's a huge crowd out there. Yeah. And it's like, that's how you know, that's where you want to be. Yeah. Most of the people are not going to get in that building. That exclusivity. But if you get the digital signage on the outside, they can at least watch it from the outside. Yeah. And, you know, we build exclusively yet inclusive.
    
    00;18;05;25 - 00;18;31;06
    Unknown
    Well, yeah. You basically you have these, this network like if it's coming up, if it's if you can't get everyone in a building. Yep. Great problem to have. First off. Yeah. But you know, you've got the digital signage at different locations. You can always go to another location if you're smart about it. You show up before that location fills up with all the people from the one you're at.
    
    00;18;31;08 - 00;18;51;01
    Unknown
    You know, if you're doing that sort of staged hearing of an event over a single day. Yeah, yeah. At that point, like for doing it like kind of like maybe at that point have like a monitor that's more like up on the stage two. Oh yeah. Shows it to them. Yeah. And that way, like you get to catch part of it like like but you're not not seeing the other one live.
    
    00;18;51;01 - 00;19;20;24
    Unknown
    It is live. But it's not like in the, in person. Well it's also streaming right. Yeah. Yeah I mean you're on your, you could be on your, you could have it on your phone. While you're at one of the events, I mean you know, just depends on like the stickiness of the experience. Right. Yeah. The, the whole idea of, of the variety I think could really, really help a bit, especially because what you want is people to have this sort of kinetic experience with it.
    
    00;19;20;24 - 00;19;41;17
    Unknown
    You don't want to people just go, you know, people that just go to a rock concert and they'll like space out for six hours and they go home. This is more like, you're still kind of present and you're part of the community and you're like, part of what's making it fun is that it's moving around and it's changing a lot.
    
    00;19;41;17 - 00;20;02;02
    Unknown
    Yeah, exactly. And and then how I'd, I feel like how it complements our platform is those people that you made friendships with and relationships with, and you got their name instead of like necessarily getting their phone number. You're like, oh, I got my profile on created on, on land. Yeah. You know. Yeah. And then they're going to go and like start building more relationships that way.
    
    00;20;02;03 - 00;20;21;07
    Unknown
    Yeah. And it makes it easy just like so it creates that stickiness and friction for more community development off of it. Yeah. Yeah. Because I mean that's what Facebook was initially like. That's how Facebook launched. They're like, oh, meet those random people. You're meeting out at college parties now. You can like not just kind of get like a random phone number.
    
    00;20;21;07 - 00;20;46;06
    Unknown
    You can like go in and like see that, talk to them. And they actually communicate more in depth. And then it grew into what it is now. Yeah. So yeah, that's that's like a big part of the vision I think you know, that's just the land, right? That's just that project within the, distributed creatives. I'm still making sure I, I'll say decentralized.
    
    00;20;46;08 - 00;21;06;14
    Unknown
    Yeah, yeah, yeah. And you know, like that makes it an excellent example for, something that can be repeated elsewhere. I, I, I was thinking, like, you do the whole thing like that in New Orleans, where people can stumble onto the streets with their drinks. Yeah. And, and enable that experience. I have a great contact down there who?
    
    00;21;06;14 - 00;21;28;29
    Unknown
    She lived in Boulder for a little bit, but she's a black woman who grew up in New Orleans, and she moved back there. All her kids are, musicians. She produced, a show for the, the radio. I was producing an internet radio station, like, in development for a couple of years. And she came in and broadcast as part of it, and she knows, like, the entire, like she she grew up there.
    
    00;21;28;29 - 00;21;45;00
    Unknown
    Cool. So she's got really deep connections to all the musicians. She's a hip hop artist herself. Oh, cool. And so that would be a great way. And so part of one of the things I've always been like envisioning, like how we can, like, you know, integrate to cities in various different ways and, and like their different flavors of experience.
    
    00;21;45;00 - 00;22;13;19
    Unknown
    Right. Because like, I, I, studied jazz piano in Boulder. So I know there's some really, like, incredible jazz musicians and some of them moved in New Orleans. Yeah. But that's a whole other scene. Yeah. Like, I would love to, like, tie hip hop into jazz. Into rock. Exactly. And then, you know, also like the sit down and watch a film and.
    
    00;22;13;22 - 00;22;31;20
    Unknown
    Oh, you speak of my listening to to the poetry, of course. Who, you know, I don't know, like, if, if comedy works in there too, I think so, I mean, I don't think there's any limit to to medium. I think basically what it is like, it gets to what I envision is very I'm going to say when it very quickly.
    
    00;22;31;20 - 00;22;52;00
    Unknown
    But like it gets to a point where each city like like, oh, here's the model, you do what you want. Yeah. Like how did the comedians figure out how they fit into it? Yeah. And like, you know, and then how we build it out like, oh, I envision is essentially each community that starts that wants to do it creates their own community leadership, and governance.
    
    00;22;52;00 - 00;23;09;17
    Unknown
    That's the kind of like here's like the structure that kind of works, but feel free to tweak it a little bit and maybe have like some mentors from like the from the DC team that is like, well, we'll help you figure it out R&D and get it working. And we part of what we have is a nonprofit is the ability to grant.
    
    00;23;09;20 - 00;23;24;20
    Unknown
    So that's part of when I was like making this as a for profit, I was like and then like thinking about like venture capital, like growing these new nodes, like having to like grow a new node and having them to be, like worried about, like having it to be profitable. Right. Which I think is filling the dead air.
    
    00;23;24;20 - 00;23;57;10
    Unknown
    Right. Yeah, exactly. And I think it will become everything will become profitable, especially when we are coming from this. Like the ability to give it the spaciousness that it needs instead of being like, like on the call or being like, oh my God, like what is going on? Like you're and so a roadmap and like also then have like be able to okay, here's 100 grand like just here it is to just do your thing and here's the infrastructure like go do it and not like and KPIs and different things like just like a normal normal business would.
    
    00;23;57;13 - 00;24;26;18
    Unknown
    But it just gives an entire different energetic quality to it. Yeah. Yeah. And I think, you know, you start in Boulder, you build that, build a straw like basically prove that it works. Yep. And then, you know, these, these digital signage they're on for I mean, the, the business isn't necessarily open 24 seven but. Basically you can broadcast something 24/7.
    
    00;24;26;18 - 00;24;50;04
    Unknown
    So there's this other angle to it, which is you take digital art that's like not necessarily performance art, like Android Jones and you know like big names and Martina Hoffman and you don't mix that in with other content and that becomes stuff that's displayed passively in the background at the, at the venues that are participating.
    
    00;24;50;06 - 00;25;14;06
    Unknown
    And you have like something that's always on. And then you once you've managed to find a way to have a 24, seven, broadcast of content, which, you know, it doesn't mean it has to be continuously different. Yeah. When it's like it's original or it can be some it can be some content that's been because it, you know, very quickly you start creating a large catalog of content.
    
    00;25;14;09 - 00;25;53;01
    Unknown
    Yeah. And most people are not going to have seen it. And so it's you and it's unique enough that like seeing a rerun, I mean even on TV people see reruns and they don't complain. Yeah. Yeah. So like I, I'm imagining this experience where, you know, maybe it's during the idle time, you're seeing more, idol type content, screen saver vibe kind of thing where, stuff is, I mean, not a screen saver, but, you know, like catered art that stayed on the screen for five minutes and then switches to another piece of art and it calls out who the artist is, and you can you can then go to this website and,
    
    00;25;53;04 - 00;26;22;22
    Unknown
    submit your art to be part of the platform. You know, ultimately, eventually that's decentralized. And it's actually Web3 content. You publish your NFT collection and then it can get pulled into the, live broadcast on the, on the network. But then you have like, at that point, you've got enough content where you can branch out to another city or town and say, look, you stick this in your window and then start adding your own content to it.
    
    00;26;22;22 - 00;26;47;28
    Unknown
    And, each, each, town can go in and choose from the app, like, I'm in Boulder, I'm in Lyons, I'm in Denver, I'm in New Orleans, San Francisco. And so it will kind of. Yeah. And it will like, cater to that stuff. But when it's not there, you get stuff from the rest of the world streaming into that location.
    
    00;26;48;04 - 00;27;08;26
    Unknown
    Yeah. And I like because I mean they already TV screen like digital signage is already a major thing. People like most bars, they have just TV streaming. Right. But this is connects you deeper into your community and it's more synergy and connection than just like, oh, that's an interesting show. I mean, like, well, it's like you're actually you're there to talk to people anyways.
    
    00;27;08;27 - 00;27;37;19
    Unknown
    Like you're not there to watch a TV show. Yeah, exactly. And you should work in a bar setting where it's noisy and you can't hear what's on the screen. Yeah. But it's like actually kind of beautiful and novel and new, and you might just pick up something from it. And that's another part of this whole concept is it's so it's so it kind of enters your brain passively, like maybe the first couple times you go to a coffee shop, you see it there, but, you know, it really doesn't really register.
    
    00;27;37;21 - 00;28;06;15
    Unknown
    And then after a while you realize it's at different locations that you're going to. And it's also, you know, streaming on YouTube, it turns out, and, once we have the sort of, large amount of content, then we can do the sort of break from the, the continuous stream for our variety show one hour, thing that maybe it happens, you know, you're doing it once a week by yourself.
    
    00;28;06;17 - 00;28;24;21
    Unknown
    And managing that, at least for now. Yeah. And, you know, I can imagine being able to do that once a week pretty easily. That could turn into five days a week, you know, ultimately. Yeah. I mean, I've thought about that. Like, it's just to exactly just getting that initial like robust notes of resources and like a little bit of a team.
    
    00;28;24;21 - 00;28;53;00
    Unknown
    Then it's just like, just, you know, and having a set up, and you need a showrunner. Yep. Exactly. And a producer. Exactly. You go from. Yeah. And by understanding that early on, we can kind of, you know, do the, the production quality to cater to that. So like, you know, proper bottom thirds. Yeah. Cuts, theme music.
    
    00;28;53;05 - 00;29;17;23
    Unknown
    Yeah. You know, so easy all the things that are. Yeah, exactly. I've done, I've done a little bit of that work. I just haven't delved into it for like. Yeah, I mean, I think obviously it takes a, it takes effort to, to structure something like that, you know. Yeah. And it keeps to the structure. But it what I'm the challenge is really how do you get these people a short attention span.
    
    00;29;17;25 - 00;29;47;02
    Unknown
    To turn it, turn on to it every day or week or month. Yeah. Yeah. I think every week we're like, you know, starting small and on schedule. But I mean, it's about a lot of times it's been proven that it's not necessarily that people only have short attention spans. Yeah. That's not fair. Yeah. Yeah. Well yeah because I've, I've done a lot of like just research about just like social media people and like if like, it's about getting their attention and getting them like it, it if you.
    
    00;29;47;02 - 00;30;10;04
    Unknown
    Yeah. Once you're in and that's like subscribed. Yeah. Exactly. And I think that's where like a lot of, like the micro content would come in and like they're like start to follow our social media and they're like, oh wait, this is like interesting and like, you know, little clips of, like the most interesting things. Yeah. And that's where like, this opus, I like it literally will take your footage and chop it up.
    
    00;30;10;04 - 00;30;32;23
    Unknown
    Also tell you like how likely it is to go viral and scrub, the TikTok logo and then post it across all of your social medias now. And it also does it like chop it up. Yeah. See, like all the tools are there, man. Yeah. And that's what I was saying like about. Yeah. You know once and it's just, it's and once that flow gets in there it's just about being consistent.
    
    00;30;32;26 - 00;30;55;16
    Unknown
    And I also have like a cop, a friend, she's like super talented social media person. And she runs for only like, you know, conscious, ethical, like social media companies. But she charges like $1,000 a month and she's like, knows how to, like, make it so that it's not just about going viral. Because, I mean, that's the thing about lot people, though, they all say they want to go viral, but they don't even know what that what to do with it.
    
    00;30;55;16 - 00;31;10;24
    Unknown
    If and if A does like how to like, you know, have the systems in place that can do it and like feed back into it. And you know, she recently it was like maybe a month or so ago. She but she sent an email saying, forget about trying to go viral like that. Like viral is bad. But she's like, I want to go mycelial.
    
    00;31;10;24 - 00;31;35;25
    Unknown
    Like you're creating this deep rootedness. So you're actually also creating the people that you that are coming across your content and liking it are like resonating with because of X, Y, and Z, but also opportunities that that compels them to try and want to connect in deeper. Yeah. I mean, my, my vision of it is, you know, every time it gets posted on YouTube, you stop everything you're doing to watch it.
    
    00;31;35;25 - 00;32;00;16
    Unknown
    Like, yeah, it's that deep, that compelling. Yeah, yeah. And, I think part of that is, like you find, like there are parts of the, the podcast model, like, if you take a look at what how Joe Rogan became huge, he, brings in huge names, you know, that, you know, maybe you hate the guy.
    
    00;32;00;18 - 00;32;27;11
    Unknown
    He hates Joe. But, certainly Elon Musk is on there. I don't necessarily think we need that, those types of people, but yeah, like he get Android Jones. They're interested in talking to them from my own perspective. Yeah, yeah. No. So that's the thing is. Yeah, yeah. And having the creative perspective, is, is like kind of where the future is, as we know, like the AI is make like making developer jobs obsolete.
    
    00;32;27;14 - 00;32;48;28
    Unknown
    Like, robots are going to take over construction work. Like essentially everyone has to be a creative in this future. So I wanted to, you know, that's one of the powers of this. And part of what the manifesto really needs is, yeah, like this painting of the what the future looks like now. And it's really like the only job is being a truly creative person.
    
    00;32;49;04 - 00;33;20;21
    Unknown
    Yeah. And so that, you know, that's another adds a great angle for us to even to incorporate be like, hey guys, we are preparing for the future. Yeah. You're all worried about UBI. We're actually providing the solutions. Yeah, yeah. Join the network. You know, find your creative juices, watch our show to like, get inspired by the artists that you're interested in and like you like you make it into that thing where big artists, every time they're about to release, they want a book on the show, you know?
    
    00;33;20;21 - 00;33;48;10
    Unknown
    So like Android, Jones comes out with a new, painting or, you know, does a new tour with, an outdoor festival. He comes on the show, talks about it for five minutes, and you show the art and you move on to like, the the next thing you have that, like, really structured thing. So even if you're not interested in the person, you'll stick in for the one hour slot to, like, see what else is happening.
    
    00;33;48;10 - 00;34;17;11
    Unknown
    Yeah. And then you get this opportunity to interview people and talk to the artists behind the works. Yeah. And then show the works and then go back to the artists afterwards. Like great, great format for like short format film. You know, you're like, hi, this is so-and-so and this is my new piece, and yeah, it's going out on Netflix and, I'm pushing it to all these other platforms, and I'm here to introduce it.
    
    00;34;17;11 - 00;34;54;12
    Unknown
    And here's a clip from it. You know, just typical of, of like late night talk show. Yeah, yeah. But all centered around creativity. Yeah. And like, well independent artists. Yeah. And like this, this format exists for like the maker community. Right. But they seem to draw the line somewhere where they're like, okay, if we're just talking about people who make models and show a bit stark on or we're just we're just doing, you know, fashion design or like, so they, they're very niche.
    
    00;34;54;14 - 00;35;22;21
    Unknown
    And I think there's room for this variety version of it. Yeah. I mean, it's definitely stick with the stir water crew. I work with the, the cafe that I work with, and we've done events. We ran an open mic here for and actually park on the east side of town for like seven years every Wednesday. And I've found this is definitely something I've thought about and like talked with people about, but we just never were able to cohesive cohere enough to actually like, bring it to life.
    
    00;35;22;24 - 00;35;51;15
    Unknown
    Well, yeah. I mean, I think having the strong vision and understanding the broadcasting streaming model, you know, turning it into the local area, local artists that. Yeah. You know, all these like extra bits, kind of glue it together. Yep. I agree, I really want to see, something where like, like I was saying, like.
    
    00;35;51;15 - 00;36;18;16
    Unknown
    Yeah. So physical art, obviously the fine arts, music and and written word and then also these brand new ones like metaverse, and Web3. Yep. All coming together. So we're just going to bring this massive like exactly this, like let's we're creating the whirlpool. Yeah. And we're gonna just bring everybody in and it's like and. Yeah.
    
    00;36;18;23 - 00;36;46;00
    Unknown
    And exactly. And I was thinking about like, how do we build it in a way that doesn't shut out platforms that are already being built? Like, how does like, how do we build in a way that potentially like lens and like warp cast and like various things like that so that we can like just like create some, especially since we're like a nonprofit like, well, this I mean, we're coming at it from the from the perfect angle to work with everyone.
    
    00;36;46;00 - 00;37;08;06
    Unknown
    Yeah. We're we're not trying to produce technology or trying to produce the art. We're trying to promote the artist. The platform, we're platform agnostic. Yeah, exactly. To the point where if somebody has got the technology, then why would we want to rebuild it? Exactly. But at the same time, like, there's no reason to stick to one platform.
    
    00;37;08;06 - 00;37;31;26
    Unknown
    Yeah. Well, I mean, I definitely I feel like in my mind, like I see something that like creating our own specific land platform, I do. Yeah. I think is necessary. Yeah. That's where the product tying of and monetizing the like tech behind what's next and that it's also like people can go like so that also was like a branded like well not like not that it's a brand but it's like a it's a packaged thing.
    
    00;37;31;29 - 00;38;07;05
    Unknown
    Yeah. So that like when we go to a community be like, hey, here's this packaged unit, it's a digital tooling, but let's take this digital tooling and then you can grow it into your community. That's where I think, like it's like the white labeled version of, yeah. What distributed creatives would be is. Yeah, exactly. And like the whole point of that is like, I love all of these digital like things and everything, but I feel like the evolution that the digital world really needs is really being rooted in real world community interaction.
    
    00;38;07;05 - 00;38;28;16
    Unknown
    And that's why I like long blog growing in. So yeah, yes, the global world is able to tune in to what we're doing, but how we're really building is community by community by community. Yeah, that's I think the land is great for that. Yeah. It it it it encourages people to get on their bike and go to the next location.
    
    00;38;28;21 - 00;39;01;24
    Unknown
    Exactly. And can't get much local or more localized in that. Exactly. And it creates that. Also like for me, it's also a more easy way. It's that kind of bigger fish. And like I like the pond thing we were talking about earlier. Yeah. Like it's easier to get your first 500 fans that are paying you. X amount of dollars, you know, a month that gives you, like, some stability.
    
    00;39;01;24 - 00;39;27;26
    Unknown
    That's like, all right, I have this coming, and I can actually I'm going to go work. I'm going to still work. Maybe a part time job, but I've got enough money, resources coming in so that I can, like, survive on that part time job. Well, I continue to refine and get my, you know, thousand audiences or whatever so that it really builds a viable roadmap or for so you can go from being an unknown to a working artist.
    
    00;39;27;26 - 00;39;57;13
    Unknown
    Yeah. Yeah. And yeah, for that to exist, because the way I see it now and I like I said, I ran a digital download store. Yeah, I've been like trying to make that work for people. And I've also seen how, controlled the whole industry is at this point. Yep. You know, it's the same phenomenon as the money system where the people with the money have all the money, you know, the same things going on with the media.
    
    00;39;57;15 - 00;40;17;00
    Unknown
    And, it has reduced the number of options for the artist. And you can't, like, support all the artists in the world unless you've got something as large as the world in place. Yeah. You know, it's for all the people in Boulder without it being enough venues for them to all perform at, you know, like you have to.
    
    00;40;17;01 - 00;40;43;28
    Unknown
    Well, and also like sales of products and, you know, not just performing. Yeah. And like the way I feel like the way to supporting all the artists is by creating a platform that brings art enthusiasts. And so then it's also taking away the, the need to. Oh, well, you have to have like 200 K in like startup capital to like get yourself to get that first album going and like all these different things.
    
    00;40;43;28 - 00;40;59;05
    Unknown
    And a lot of that was really done to control the artists, you know, they wouldn't because I've done a lot of research. You know, why the music should they like? Oh, we're going to give you like $1 million like advance, right? They don't tell you that. Hear back. Yeah. Exactly. Like, well, how much studio time did you just do.
    
    00;40;59;11 - 00;41;27;17
    Unknown
    Oh, all of that jewelry that we told you you needed to buy to so that you can look like. So that you can look the part so suddenly you're like, oh, wait, I just sold X amount of albums. And I'm like, well, actually, did you read the contract? And actually you're actually this amount of money? Well, yeah, I this, this comes back to a core principle, which is the, micro, entrepreneur.
    
    00;41;27;19 - 00;41;59;05
    Unknown
    Yeah. Or the gig economist of one. Yeah. Or you know, where, like, all of this stuff works and you're getting paid directly. Yeah. And I think, you know, that's where the blockchain Web3 stuff can really help. I think it's essential to be able to. And NFT of whatever you're doing. And then because it's part of the, a collective of other people, like that community thing, which is so important to the whole NFT phenomenon.
    
    00;41;59;05 - 00;42;24;06
    Unknown
    Yeah. It's like, oh, you're buying this because you love the art, and also because it's part of this collective that's, you know, got all this other stuff going on in it that means there's some sort of value to the experience that you're buying into as well. Like I think, you know, and I agree, you can't not everyone's art should be performed, nor should people be expected to perform in order to make money.
    
    00;42;24;06 - 00;42;53;27
    Unknown
    And like the what the beautiful model that started roughly around when the Beatles were formed was you could write something amazing, you could cut it to vinyl and move it across the world. Everyone would love it, consume it, and it would be enough to survive on or thrive on. Yeah, Nielsen's a perfect example of that. He never really performed yet was able to like do live a full career and might be very successful.
    
    00;42;54;04 - 00;43;14;15
    Unknown
    Yeah, you get fucked over. I think it was manager or somebody you had to like literally like Sue them and fight for it right back later in his life. Yeah. I mean, there's terrible stories, you know? Yeah. Jimi Hendrix was screwed over. Oh, yeah. Horribly. And if you listen to enough Hip-Hop, like, I mean, like, almost every great, like, hip hop artist, you know, there is like, you know, what doesn't matter.
    
    00;43;14;15 - 00;43;34;17
    Unknown
    It doesn't have to go into details. I mean, they have Michael Jackson track, Michael Jackson, just the shady the industry is Michael Jackson, but Paul McCartney's entire collection and Paul McCartney asked to buy it all back and he wouldn't. Yeah. Like the, you know, like that whole model just stinks. And then it just dried up, you know, like it, you know, it seems there.
    
    00;43;34;20 - 00;43;58;18
    Unknown
    Yep. Napster and BitTorrent. Thanks, Bram. Like, you know, like, changed the landscape. And I watched that happen. Right when I wanted it to be there for me, you know, right when I was, like, trying to make a career out of it, and it it's it's affected me so much that 30 years later, I'm still like, trying to find the solution to that.
    
    00;43;58;18 - 00;44;19;00
    Unknown
    That's what drives me at this point. It's like, yeah. How do you how do we get back to that model that worked? So that worked so well before. And I think, you know, really is the NFT, thing beyond the bubble that was created just from. Yeah, digital art is like getting like the thing is. Yeah, exactly. And like for me, like where the whole with Napster everything.
    
    00;44;19;00 - 00;44;37;07
    Unknown
    Because like, I was like in middle school, like high school, like I was like, well, yeah, yeah. Music. I mean, yeah, free music. I'll take it all. I know those feel like it was like that, that not like there's the idea of, like the traditional, like exposure. That's all. Artists have always been kind of, jerked around with.
    
    00;44;37;10 - 00;44;59;27
    Unknown
    But that like, it's about then creating a culture where you do exposure, get exposure, but also how do we create a culture of people that are listening and recognizing that there's value there and be like, oh yeah, whatever. I listen to you a lot here's like some money, like, yeah, let me just make it really easy to just be like, boom, like boom, there's some money to your way, like ten bucks changes the art form itself to oh yeah, yeah.
    
    00;44;59;28 - 00;45;23;14
    Unknown
    The concept album. Yeah. Where like masterpieces were written. Because people knew that they were going to be bought and you would listen to the intro song and then, you know, the story behind this. But yeah. What I mean, even back in the day, like the Beatles, like why I like a lot of the songs were like the even like Jimi Hendrix, like while some of his music was hard to get on the air because it's not fitting that 3 to 4 minute like this is what we have.
    
    00;45;23;17 - 00;45;48;23
    Unknown
    But the experience. Yeah. Have you been experienced? Yeah. You know, that whole like vibe like we lost something incredibly important. Yeah I agree now music is even now they're like literally the way they're making it for Spotify. Like, I've heard like podcasts and stuff about it. It's completely. Oh yeah. Yeah. People are really just like, killing, uploading, like completely manipulating the way people even write.
    
    00;45;48;23 - 00;46;10;00
    Unknown
    Yeah, 2.5 minutes, like 3 or 4 choruses, like there's a formula and it's like, yeah, yeah. And how they like choose what songs go on the album and what what is the first song and like, yeah, yeah. And now it's like, you know, and you're just chasing pennies. You know, even like, I think it was Snoop Dogg.
    
    00;46;10;06 - 00;46;35;14
    Unknown
    Yeah. Snoop Dogg was complaining about, like, I gotta head out of like, 235 ish. So we got, like, 35, 40 minutes. Yeah. Steve Dog was complaining about, you know, millions and millions of views or listens on Spotify and getting, like, 20,000 bucks for it. Yeah, I have, I have a friends with the band that have a million plus views on their, what, a couple of their songs.
    
    00;46;35;16 - 00;46;52;27
    Unknown
    And it's, I think, making a career. Yeah, I think it was actually billions from Snoop. But yeah. Yeah. Just crazy. You know, the point is that like, it's not like it's like if. Yeah, if you can complaining about if you had a million, if you had a million listeners any other era. Yeah. Thank you. That's like most of them.
    
    00;46;52;29 - 00;47;15;22
    Unknown
    Yeah. So okay. With the limited time. Yeah. I think we covered like, you know, the core concepts of the land stuff. Yep. We've got our, our drafts for the White Paper manifesto. Yep. We've got somewhat of a roadmap. I work on that more. Yeah I, I need to kind of there's, I read through all that stuff.
    
    00;47;15;22 - 00;47;39;29
    Unknown
    I was like I need to add a few little things here and there, like just details that helped sell the idea clearly. That I need, I want to add, I've registered the domains. Beautiful. I saw that, I started with the first round of logos. Yeah, there was definitely some that stood out. I feel like I didn't know feel like any of them, like, fully hit.
    
    00;47;39;29 - 00;47;57;21
    Unknown
    Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's good. That means you're picky. Yeah, that's fine. But, you know, just trying to find, like a logo. Logo mark so I can put together a website. Yeah, I like the one that hit me. The connected the most was like the purple and blue one that kind of like, had like, line. And it kind of.
    
    00;47;57;24 - 00;48;13;19
    Unknown
    Yeah. It. Yeah. The challenge is it has to work in black and white even if we do color version. Yeah. But yeah. Yeah. Like, I thought you might like that one. Yeah. I feel like it's important to, like, have maybe a distributed creative where it's written, but I feel like we definitely need a smaller one to.
    
    00;48;13;19 - 00;48;41;16
    Unknown
    Yeah. Like it would be the logo mark and then the logo text mark. Yeah. Is the text with the mark? Yeah, yeah. So we have both of them so we can do like really short. Like I'm thinking about this in terms of the broadcast network and. Yeah. And I'm thinking like in terms of like modern like logos, like I was looking at like Amazon's logo and like what they have like the A with the smile and like, yeah, like something like within it, like there's something within the DCU or whatever that like is something that could whatever.
    
    00;48;41;16 - 00;49;01;10
    Unknown
    But you know, in like the face. Yeah, it is the f if you, if yeah, if you think of something sketch it and send it. Yeah. I'm going to still just like but just sit with it. Yeah. That's not isn't important. We can we can always do a like get the site up. Yeah. Exactly. With maybe just pure text or whatever.
    
    00;49;01;10 - 00;49;26;21
    Unknown
    Yeah. And I mean we can have a working logo, you know, we'll need an icon even just so that that we can have the icon in the browser. Yeah. Tabs, you will need something, but, like. Yeah. So we can set up the website. I can post that stuff. We'll need, like a couple of pages, or at least a landing page worth of breakdown of the the true vision of it.
    
    00;49;26;21 - 00;49;57;25
    Unknown
    Yeah. And then obviously, the next thing is the, making the land digital signage and content happen, and, I think the digital signage thing should be a web page, so you can you just one way or another, make the web page full screen on your, at your, venue and you're, you're showing it. We can make it more involved later, but yeah, like the first version.
    
    00;49;57;25 - 00;50;21;00
    Unknown
    Might as well just be, basically a web page that's kind of like it is like the Distributed Creators website. And then the one there's like a tab. Yeah, that just broadcast tab or whatever. Yeah. And yeah, you can like, eventually you'll be able to choose your location. You'll be able to say whether you're allowed to have advertising and, you know, because I was talking about the Boulder.
    
    00;50;21;03 - 00;50;48;29
    Unknown
    Yeah. City ordinances and what, they're allowing a window. So we can work on, on that. But what'll quickly become necessary is, lining up some content. Yep. Some like and an understanding that variety of that we want to put on the screen and tying it into the, the one hour show and kind of like building that, by having enough people involved.
    
    00;50;48;29 - 00;51;06;04
    Unknown
    And I feel like we could pretty easily get Android to, I think, so work. I mean, like, I've got connections directly to him. Yeah. I mean, he he does shows at the at the Fiske Planetarium. Yeah, yeah. My friend is the one that produces them actually. Juicy. All right. Yeah, I yeah, I mean, I've talked to them.
    
    00;51;06;11 - 00;51;27;20
    Unknown
    Well, I thought his, his wife slash girlfriend took the bulk of the incoming offers, but, Yeah, I'm the. I just know that, like. But when is to you. Yeah. Yeah. We've got like, a lot of, like he also like when I the previous name of this project all was New Revolution. Revolution. And it was like a magazine and different things.
    
    00;51;27;20 - 00;51;43;29
    Unknown
    And he was going to be featured in it. So like, he knows who I am. And like, when he was his, his whole studio burned down. Yeah, I know, so but I went over there and, like, helped him like some do some cleaning and stuff. Oh, wow. Yeah, yeah. So there's a lot of, like, really close weaves.
    
    00;51;44;02 - 00;52;03;04
    Unknown
    Cool. Yeah. So actually one of my good friends actually was his. I don't know if she still is, but she was his nanny and stuff. So there's like so many like just close interweaving. Yeah. And once we get the obviously the reason to have his buy in is because then we'll be able to go to other people around him.
    
    00;52;03;04 - 00;52;33;16
    Unknown
    Yeah. And then introduce other, you know, visionary art, to the platform. And that that is a really good way to fill that passive time. And then, and then the whole other part, the last ingredient is figuring out the streaming to these locations. So, you know, like that's that's the part I'll be focusing on is like the tech behind it.
    
    00;52;33;16 - 00;52;52;11
    Unknown
    Like, yeah, I mean, that's the game yard where you get cameras for each location to and like build out. So that'll be like a little bit of a budget that says like, all right, we come in and we that could also be part of our. So like we can come in and set up your venue. Yeah. So that like we set up the streaming and all of the different things.
    
    00;52;52;11 - 00;53;40;08
    Unknown
    Yeah. But we're like, hey this is we're using this for when we're doing it, but you have access to do this for your other shows and events that can give more of a, toolkit for them to do more with their stuff. Yeah. And that could be no more incentive. Right. And yeah, what we need to do is work out some of the, like challenges for, for like, for example, when we go down to the festival, we'll, we'll get it kind of quick, quickly understand, you know, how that would integrate, like in terms of, streaming and video location and, like how digital signage would work on a piece of remote land?
    
    00;53;40;08 - 00;53;56;28
    Unknown
    Yeah. I mean, I've definitely been thinking because I was up and down there already. Yeah. So I've, I've got a lot of different ideas and I was thinking that like digital, they basically they've got like a wall. There's like, you know, there's like 4 or 5 different ones that are there that like have different streaming art that are all artists at the festival.
    
    00;53;57;00 - 00;54;18;24
    Unknown
    And then you could they, would they have the. Yeah. And then I was thinking like a gallery specifically next year, the goal is to get a gallery there. Like, did your gallery okay, specifically a digital gallery. They have a full they have an art gallery this year. Yeah, but it's not digital. So, like the have you seen, what's his name?
    
    00;54;22;08 - 00;54;44;28
    Unknown
    Darn it, I forgot his name. The guy with, big NFT collection is sold for 69,000. Yeah, yeah. 60 ML. Yeah. He his digital art gallery is kind of like the top end variation of that. Yeah. We've got multiple screens and it's broadcast, and you have events in it. People come to do live art, that kind of thing.
    
    00;54;45;00 - 00;55;11;20
    Unknown
    Yeah. So anyway, I want to make sure you're you're out of here when you need to be. Yeah. But, so I think that we've covered a lot of that, I think, you know, kind of bringing it back down to, what you're doing here and maybe bringing in artists, like live musicians in your space and stuff like that would be really good.
    
    00;55;11;20 - 00;55;33;18
    Unknown
    Yeah, those are definitely all things, one to do. And I've been in conversations. Biggest hurdles, just like, you know, the time and the energy it takes. Yeah. Yeah. Having to be organized enough to be like, all right, like, I emailed these ten people, like. And then, like, these ones are organized within this and like, spreadsheets, it's going to be it's going to be a lot easier when you've got a website to send them to.
    
    00;55;33;18 - 00;55;56;07
    Unknown
    Yeah, we've got digital signage. Yeah. Exactly. At the restaurant, I'm just like I just keep reminding myself, just like, you know, we're going to have to figure out that that road map in particular, like, yeah, Riverside's not going to want to put up a TV with no content. Yep. Well, I've also got a, like, a really good community of digital artists.
    
    00;55;56;07 - 00;56;17;14
    Unknown
    Yeah. So that, like, that might be the first. Yeah. Stepping stone. Yeah. I say we put together this kind of the initial roadmap. Yeah. Maybe even I talked to Miranda. Yeah. She's the one that like, does like the, like, I think the event coordination and space coordination. Yeah. And just be like, hey, this is what we are getting, what we're thinking.
    
    00;56;17;17 - 00;56;33;15
    Unknown
    And then once they kind of. And then once that happens that she's like, oh, this is interesting, then I can reach out to my community of artists. So we're not, I think that could be good. Yeah. Okay. We already have. We have a it entices them to be like, oh, well, that there's something already starting to emerge.
    
    00;56;33;15 - 00;56;55;19
    Unknown
    So one of the pages on the website, our website is going to be the Land Project. Yep. And then we'll be able to send Miranda to that and be like, here's the down low. Yeah. The details and how we can set it up. And then, yeah, we need to do some tech tests with, like, I think the GoPros that people are using for YouTube look excellent.
    
    00;56;55;24 - 00;57;23;16

    Yeah, I don't know which ones those are. And but they have a limited they're, they're I think they have autofocus on them. And like, you can point them at a location and then we'll need like, certain types of miking and mixing board. Yeah.

    Unknown
    I used to be his tech. Yeah, but like when all that kind of crap that he, got me to. Oh, I know, oh, I know, he got worse than me. He got worse than me, dude. He like, when all that came out, like, I read, like, thoroughly about it because he he still. He had to start in Boulder.
    
    01;00;47;17 - 01;01;06;26
    Unknown
    I know, yeah, I know and like my wife that was my wife was in Boulder. And so like just like that little family ranch community. So sad to hear that. I could see why that happened. Because he was he he could get anything he wanted. Oh, well, I know in terms of female attention. Well, I know I was reading about the he just went about it in like the most shady way.
    
    01;01;06;26 - 01;01;27;03
    Unknown
    Like he was like so lady like just like throw like a bag of money at him. And he was like, dude, like, come on, like that.

    01;01;27;03 - 01;01;46;20

Just like you bring me something that's like, yeah, so. But, yeah. Yeah. I hear that. Yeah. So I think we've got a good plan. I think, you know, once we've got the land project going, even in the smallest version, asking for money and getting it is going to be a piece of cake.
    
    01;02;14;17 - 01;02;44;04
    Unknown
    I, I agree, I totally agree one like I between our stories that we have like in the pitch deck that we can like put in and having that first even just having it at just the coffee stand. Yeah. That's is like hey here, like we did this and yeah Haiti like has like so many of these like she's got all the connections and like part of like what inspired me to like think about doing this as a nonprofit was Brewster the founder of the Internet Archive?
    
    01;02;44;06 - 01;03;02;24
    Unknown
    He's just like, well, I just gave I know him, too. Yeah, yeah, I think we talked about oh, okay. All right. Yeah, yeah. But because she's good friends with him, like she actually built her a, they took a whole and made a, an of empty holes literally found in like, the bay, just like stuck on a bridge. And it's a giant cement hall.
    
    01;03;02;27 - 01;03;24;12
    Unknown
    But they refurbished it and now it's a full, solar powered generator. So they can, like, when they go do parties, like, in the middle of the Delta. They got like a full solar power grid to run the party. That's great. But Brewster was like target Uber trying to launch a Dow and stuff, and it's kind of was an earlier versions of kind of this concepts.
    
    01;03;24;15 - 01;03;43;02
    Unknown
    And I was talking about just different, different ideas. And he's like, well, I just gave everything away for free. And it worked out great. Yeah. Yeah. And so that he's like one of these key people that I think, like we in Haiti will just like he'll there's like give us like the direct in and we're like, hey, here's this whole thing and we're not trying to make money off of it.
    
    01;03;43;05 - 01;04;19;21
    Unknown
    Yeah. He's like, oh yeah, here's 100,000. Yeah okay. Yeah. That's what we need is and then my cash injection. Yeah. My mother in law, it's like one of her best friends is the founder, the family behind Kendall Jackson Wine. And they're just have their billionaires. Cool. And, you know, even, like, 50, like, here's a here's a project, 50,000, you know, and that's the thing is, like, what we're building, like, 50,000 will make us we'll be able to like, build a huge like first, like initial like, what is, and the MVP.
    
    01;04;19;23 - 01;04;41;22
    Unknown
    Yeah. You know, like, if we just got, we don't even need that. Hold to 200 K. Yeah. Like, if they just gave us, if we just got like 30 K, we could build a whole bunch of this initial infrastructure that says, like here and like, get like the initial, like operating and start like onboarding the initial artists. And then all of a sudden like that 150 K the doors just because we've already proven ourselves.
    
    01;04;41;22 - 01;05;09;19
    Unknown
    Yeah, yeah, I think the so yeah. One of the reasons that I started this conversation with the whole, like, we can build this tech and then make money from the tech on the side thing is that I can see like, the land stuff and the digital signage being something that like as soon as it's working well, even at the Riverside, the, the whole one local thing will love to like, integrate that.
    
    01;05;09;19 - 01;05;35;21
    Unknown
    Yeah. Like exactly. Once you've got like a physical thing in people's faces, it's just so much more interesting, you know. Yeah, exactly. And people just start to see it and experience it and they're like, wait a minute, is that just a TV show? Wait, I actually know those some of those people, right. And it creates that like it's all of a sudden also like in a way, because people still I think there's this energy of like, oh my God, that's my friend on TV energy.
    
    01;05;35;21 - 01;05;54;20
    Unknown

    01;05;54;20 - 01;06;18;04
    Unknown
    Okay. But I don't know if that's in time or not. I mean, this, I mean, basically the this happens the weekend after, so it's like it's not this weekend but next weekend. So it's like the 14th which is Thursday through. It's like Thursday through Sunday. Right. And I'm not sure what day I can find out the exact day that the poetry stuff is that the but that the event is on.
    
    01;06;18;07 - 01;06;36;21
    Unknown
    But any as long as we only pay for his gas to get there or something. Oh, well, we could at least. Yeah, I can talk to them. But we can for sure. Get him a free ticket. Yeah. And I can talk to I can discuss. He doesn't know too much about it yet because he's. Yeah, like, I wasn't sure if it was going to work out at all until ten minutes before I got here.
    
    01;06;36;21 - 01;06;53;00
    Unknown
    And, I mean, honestly, if he got it here and was able to give me the speakers and stuff, I would be happy to transport it down there. Yeah. If they whatever. And then he if but if he wanted to go, we could figure that out too. Yeah. I think yeah, we'll have to figure that out. But and it's also.
    
    01;06;53;00 - 01;07;12;11
    Unknown
    I'm not even sure like what hardware has survived being in storage. Yeah. So, like, we kind of have to do a triage of the hardware. Okay. Yeah. And if it's if it's too much, it doesn't matter. It's cutting it close. But it'd be awesome if it worked out. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'm reaching out to like, other, like, all my different contacts and just seeing what.
    
    01;07;12;11 - 01;07;31;02

    Unknown
    And really, worst comes to worst, we're going to be in the art gallery, and we don't necessarily even need to be miked. Yeah, like it might end up being like because I have some really nice, electric voice. Like most of the stuff is really large scale. Yeah, sound gear, but I have these two ones on poles.
    
    01;07;50;00 - 01;08;08;16

    Yeah, that we use for monitors, but they're also like full range. Yeah, that's exactly what we have. That's what you need. Yeah, that's exactly what I'm looking. What I was asking for. A worst case. One of them needs repair, and the other one works. Yeah, but I just don't remember the state that. Yeah, I told the I've worked with gear like that.
    
    01;08;08;17 - 01;08;34;23
    Unknown
    Yeah. But, yeah, he might be stoked to, like, just get back into it. He's he's super broke. He's actually hiding from the law right now because. Okay, unable to pay some hospital bill or something like that. Oh, God. So he, like, like. Yeah, man, you can have my gear. You can try to earn the money so you can, like, show your face in public without being worried about being hauled to jail.
    
    01;08;34;24 - 01;08;56;20
    Unknown
    Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, like, if we can give him money, that's great. But he's very passionate about getting back into it because he. Yeah, he ran my sound system, okay. For like, nine years. Okay, so he's and he's got a great ear, but, Yeah. Well, you know, yeah, there's a little backstory there. Yeah, totally. I understand all of that.
