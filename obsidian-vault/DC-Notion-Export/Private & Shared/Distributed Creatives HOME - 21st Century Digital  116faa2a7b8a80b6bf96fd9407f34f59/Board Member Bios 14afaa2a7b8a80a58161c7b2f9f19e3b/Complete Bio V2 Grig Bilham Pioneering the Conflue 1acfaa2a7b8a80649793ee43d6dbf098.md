# Complete Bio V2: Grig Bilham: Pioneering the Confluence of Technology, Music, and Community (1)

## Executive Director & Co-Founder, Distributed Creatives

Grig Bilham embodies the rare fusion of technological visionary, musician, entrepreneur, and philosophical thinker. Over a 25-year career spanning multiple disciplines, he has consistently bridged the gap between creativity and technology, developing revolutionary platforms that have transformed how artists create, distribute, and monetize their work. His lifelong commitment to balancing both hemispheres of the brain—the analytical and the creative—has produced a unique perspective that informs his current mission of building a more equitable, sustainable future for creators worldwide.

## Early Life and Formative Influences

Grig's journey into the world of technology and music began in childhood, shaped by parents who recognized and encouraged his natural inclinations. His father, an accordion player with a deep appreciation for technology's potential, purchased one of the earliest personal computers—a Mac 256—when Grig was still in junior high school. This early exposure to computing sparked what would become a lifelong passion for exploring the boundaries of digital tools and systems.

As a young student, Grig would sketch user interfaces on paper during class, then return home to program them. He meticulously wrote code in BASIC by hand before testing it on the computer, developing a structured approach to creation that would later characterize his professional methodology.

His formal musical training began at age seven after attending a bluegrass concert that ignited his fascination with the fiddle. His parents arranged for him to study with a private violin tutor from Juilliard during their time in New York. Over the next five years, Grig's dedication led him to the position of second chair in the Boulder Youth Symphony and participation in a quartet that performed throughout Boulder, Colorado.

This early immersion in classical music developed not only his technical skills but also a deep understanding of musical structure and theory that would later inform his electronic music endeavors. The rigorous violin training instilled principles of composition, harmony, and precision that would later surface in his Neuronaut productions, enabling him to blend structured musicality with electronic experimentation.

As he entered adolescence, Grig's musical interests expanded into electronic music, though resources were limited at that time. He discovered Kraftwerk, one of the few purely electronic acts available, which sparked extensive exploration in music stores where he absorbed diverse musical influences that would eventually inform his own creative output.

Grig's early experiences with technology were equally formative. Beyond using his family's Mac 256, he attended computer camp where he quickly advanced from student to teacher. His experimentation with early Apple technologies like HyperCard and ResEdit gave him foundational skills in low-level programming and user interface design—skills that would later manifest in intuitive, user-friendly platforms like Addictech and Mintr.

## Educational Journey and Technical Foundations

Grig's formal education in computer science included early classes in C programming in the early 1990s, a time when computer science degrees were still relatively uncommon. His first significant professional application emerged during this period—a tool for USGS to track earthquakes on a map, written for the Atari STE. He successfully generated a colored topographic map that plotted earthquakes in real-time from various instruments, with alerts sent to pagers so data could be received immediately as earthquakes occurred globally.

This system remained in use at the USGS office in Boulder for approximately 20 years, representing an early example of Grig's ability to create enduring, practical technological solutions. Its influence extended beyond its immediate application, as aspects of its user interface were reportedly adopted by Iris, the seismic detection service.

Throughout his education, Grig maintained parallel interests in music and technology, reflecting the dual-hemisphere thinking that would become his signature strength. This integration of artistic and technical modes of thought allowed him to see possibilities that specialists in either domain might miss—a competitive advantage that has driven innovation throughout his career.

## Musical Evolution and the San Francisco Scene

Grig's musical journey continued through high school, where he formed several small electronic bands inspired by industrial acts like Nine Inch Nails and Skinny Puppy. Simultaneously, he began his earliest solo electronic music productions under the moniker "Neuronaut," a project he has continued to develop for approximately 35 years.

During his final years of high school, he formed a band with his brother and friends that would remain active for nearly two decades. While Grig initially had the most musical background, his brother quickly developed his guitar skills. Their collaboration blended shared appreciation for 1970s rock influences like The Doors, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and Eric Clapton with emerging electronic sounds.

This period saw Grig and his bandmates deeply engage with music theory, seeking out professional jazz musician teachers to expand their understanding. Grig began studying under Art Lande, an acclaimed pianist, jazz artist, and drummer based in Boulder. This jazz training profoundly influenced his approach to composition, providing insights into form, intervals, and the deliberate use of dissonance that continue to inform his musical work today.

His musical influences extended far beyond Western traditions, including Indian musicians like Zakir Hussein and Ravi Shankar, highlighting the global perspective that has enriched his compositional approach. This eclectic range of influences—from classical to jazz, rock to world music—created a rich foundation for his own creative expressions.

In 2000, seeking broader opportunities, Grig and his band relocated to San Francisco to embed themselves in the vibrant electronic music scene. They took a strategic approach by purchasing a professional-grade sound system, which they leveraged to secure early performances by both playing at events and providing sound equipment, creating mutually beneficial arrangements with event organizers.

For approximately 20 years, Grig was deeply immersed in the San Francisco Bay Area's underground electronic music culture. As "Neuronaut," he performed regularly at outdoor festivals and club events, while also managing sound systems for large gatherings. His electronic compositions gained significant recognition, earning him slots at major festivals alongside artists who would later achieve international prominence, including Tipper, Bassnectar, and Glitch Mob.

Notably, in recent years, Grig has continued to perform as Neuronaut, with highlights including opening for Beck in Boulder and touring Europe with performances at Scottish castles. His artistic practice remains active, with plans for 2025 including releasing a new composable music album, playing events, hosting laptop battles through Distributed Creatives, and performing at festivals in Colorado and California. This ongoing engagement with music performance and production demonstrates his continued commitment to artistic expression alongside his technical and entrepreneurial pursuits.

## Addictech: Revolutionizing Digital Music Distribution

In 2004, the same year Apple released the iPod, Grig co-founded Addictech, a pioneering digital music platform that would transform how electronic musicians distributed their work and connected with audiences.

Recognizing the inequities in existing distribution models, he built Addictech with a revolutionary approach: returning 70-80% of sales revenue directly to artists, establishing a creator-first business model years before such concepts became mainstream discussions in the technology industry. The platform's success was driven by Grig's dedication and commitment to self-funding, ultimately generating millions in revenue for creators.

The platform's success was immediate and substantial. Within just 16 months, Addictech had distributed $2 million to electronic musicians, demonstrating both the viability of more equitable compensation models and Grig's technical ability to implement complex systems at scale. This achievement is particularly remarkable given that it occurred nearly a decade before platforms like Bandcamp would adopt similar artist-forward revenue models.

As both founder and CTO, Grig personally handled all aspects of the platform's development and operation. He was among the earliest adopters of Amazon Web Services, utilizing storage and EC2 instances at such an early stage that even Amazon's technical advisors sometimes struggled to provide support. This pioneering use of cloud technology placed Addictech at the technological forefront while allowing it to scale efficiently to serve a growing global audience.

Addictech's technical innovation extended to its music discovery system, which Grig describes as the first streaming radio service of its kind. What made their approach unique was the use of tagging combined with expert curation. A group of genre specialists listened to every song and added detailed tags to categorize them. These tags then powered an exceptionally accurate recommendation system that created tailored listening experiences. Users could specify preferences like "deep bass, no vocals, specific tempo range," and the system would introduce them to new music that precisely matched their tastes while exposing them to catalog items they might otherwise never discover.

The success of the platform led to the establishment of Addictech Records, which published approximately 100 releases for an impressive roster of electronic artists. The label's first release came from Grig's own Neuronaut project, followed by works from artists including E-Prom, Lawgivers, Audio Void, Brand Richards, Vent, OPU, Bird of Prey, Casantila, Side Bag, The Fruit Bat, Digital Rest, AMB, Spoon Bill, Fine Cut Bodies, Griff, Ivank, Bill Bless, and Bog Trotter—all electronic musicians from their network who chose to collaborate with the label.

For 16 years, Addictech remained a cornerstone of the electronic music community, only concluding when Grig sold the business in 2018 to pursue new ventures. The platform's longevity and success stand as testament to both the technical robustness of Grig's implementation and the ethical soundness of its artist-first business model—a model that has informed his subsequent work with Distributed Creatives and continues to influence his vision for more equitable creative economies.

## Philosophical Journey and Spiritual Exploration

Parallel to his musical and technological development, Grig embarked on a profound philosophical journey that has shaped his worldview and approach to creative work. His extensive travels have been instrumental in this evolution, offering perspectives on human experience beyond the American context and deepening his appreciation for the quality of life and opportunities available in the United States compared to some other regions he has visited.

In India, where he spent two months, he collaborated with a professor to interpret Sanskrit texts and locate ancient temple sites. They conducted research on sacred sites, interpreting Sanskrit texts to determine the locations of temples mentioned in ancient writings. Their expeditions into remote jungle areas often led to the discovery of previously undocumented temple sites. When they mapped these locations using GPS, they found that the sites aligned in a pattern resembling the shape of the Ganges River, revealing a sophisticated sacred geography.

His time in India included visits to spiritually significant sites like Bodhgaya, where Buddha attained enlightenment, and participation in the Mahakumbh Mela, a grand confluence of faith and culture centered around pilgrimages that represent the universe. During this journey, a conversation with a spiritual leader revealed a universal truth that would stay with him: when asked about the greatest lesson from all the sacred texts he had memorized through song, the leader emphasized the golden rule—do unto others as you would have done unto yourself.

This principle of reciprocity and empathy has guided Grig's approach to business and community building, manifesting in platforms that prioritize fair compensation for creators and technologies that serve rather than exploit users. His spiritual explorations have directly informed his professional ethics, creating a cohesive philosophy that unifies his diverse endeavors.

The Boulder area offered Grig meaningful connections with significant counter-cultural figures. He had fortunate opportunities to meet and spend time with visionary painter Robert Venosa, philosopher Terence McKenna, and artist Martina Hoffmann. His relationship with ethnobotanist and philosopher Terence McKenna became particularly significant, resulting in collaborations on art pieces and website development. Grig also created a website for Venosa, which is reportedly still maintained by Martina Hoffmann today.

These collaborations with visionary artists and thinkers enriched Grig's understanding of the intersection between technology, art, and consciousness, with McKenna providing particularly deep inspiration that Grig continues to value.

In California, Grig met spiritual teacher Ram Dass, whose acknowledgment of Grig's ability to discuss spiritual matters meaningfully affirmed his developing philosophical framework. Ram Dass expressed appreciation for Grig's capacity to engage with spiritual concepts, recognizing the depth of understanding and specialized vocabulary that Grig had developed through extensive reading and study.

Grig's reading has been equally expansive, encompassing works by Terence McKenna, Alan Watts, Eckhart Tolle, and various Stoic philosophers. These intellectual explorations helped him navigate the often chaotic energy of San Francisco's cultural landscape while maintaining his authentic optimism and open-heartedness.

He found particular resonance in Stoicism's emphasis on recognizing life's brevity as a catalyst for meaningful action. After reading hundreds of books, Stoic philosophy particularly resonated with him through its focus on mortality awareness as a source of motivation and purpose. By meditating on the finite nature of life, he believes we gain the impetus to take meaningful actions for ourselves and others that we might otherwise postpone or neglect.

This philosophical grounding has informed his approach to technology and business, viewing both as potential vehicles for positive social change rather than mere profit-generating mechanisms. The principles he absorbed through spiritual study and practice have manifested in his creation of more equitable business models, his commitment to open-source development, and his vision for technology that empowers rather than exploits creative communities.

## Technical Career and Comprehensive Innovation

Grig's technical accomplishments span multiple decades and technological paradigms, demonstrating remarkable versatility and foresight. His professional development work began in 1994 with the USGS earthquake monitoring system, which displayed real-time earthquake data on topographic maps and sent alerts to pagers. This early success, created while still a university student, established a pattern of building practical, impactful technological solutions that would define his career.

Throughout the 1990s, he developed e-learning tools for organizations including Jefferson County Schools, Norwest Bank, TeleTech, Lucent Technologies, Mall of America, McGraw-Hill, NBC, PBS, and the National Institutes of Health. At Digital Creators (1997-1999), he led the development of educational and corporate multimedia titles, managing multidisciplinary teams while creating storyboards, technical specifications, 3D models, animations, and music.

During this period, Grig developed more than ten multimedia educational and corporate titles. He managed teams of over fifteen multidisciplinary professionals, meeting aggressive deadlines while personally creating storyboards, design documentation, UI design patterns, 3D models and animations, video, and music. His responsibilities included testing, debugging, and shipping CD-ROMs with cross-platform compatibility, and he produced cognitive learning games, interactive training videos, and virtual simulations.

The early 2000s saw Grig expand into enterprise-level application development. At Laszlo Systems (2001-2003), he served as a Developer Relations Engineer for the company's innovative scripting language designed for managing Rich Internet Applications in Adobe Flash. He developed best-practice example applications and solved problems for customers using the company's evolving scripting language for enterprise code management in Adobe Flash. His success in acquiring the first paying client for Laszlo resulted in his promotion to primary developer relations engineer.

His work with Warner Brothers Music included developing music applications for social media platforms, customized for artists including Miranda Lambert, Taking Back Sunday, Mike Jones, and Al Gore's Live Earth initiative. For Disney-ABC, he developed "WipeOut Yourself," a Facebook game based on the popular TV show that garnered an impressive 5 million likes.

Other notable projects from this period include an award-winning kiosk application for Behr Paint, installed in Home Depot stores nationwide and featured in national television advertising campaigns. Grig helped design, develop, test, and release this groundbreaking experience for both Behr Paint's website and kiosks in 1,600 Home Depot locations.

As technology evolved, so did Grig's expertise. At Autodesk, he designed and developed prototypes for the company's Project Cyborg dashboard, using WebGL to create a seamless visualization interface. His work with NewPathVR included developing VR experiences for cognitive behavioral therapy, available on Oculus Rift and HTC Vive platforms. For Viscira, he designed and developed multiple HoloLens applications using Unity, and for AbbVie Humira, he created augmented reality demonstrations for international trade shows.

Throughout his career, Grig has shipped over 60 digital products across diverse platforms and technologies. He has personally handled nearly all aspects of these projects, including design, front-end and back-end coding, and deployment. This comprehensive technical expertise spans programming languages (C#, C++, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, PHP, Python, Rust, Swift), web technologies (Angular, React, Vue.js, Node.js), game engines (Unity, Unreal), AR/VR platforms (ARCore, ARKit, Hololens, Magic Leap, Oculus, Vive), and cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google).

In 2019, Grig joined MixMan Technologies as CTO, serving as Product Designer, Senior Engineer, Platform Architect, and Lead Developer for Modify, a groundbreaking multi-channel music application. Modify enables users to mix professional music with real-time 3D visuals to produce shareable content for video streaming, NFTs, and the metaverse. His comprehensive involvement in the project—from initial design and prototype development to team building and technical architecture—resulted in both the prototype and minimum viable product being delivered ahead of schedule.

Grig contributed to every phase of the project, from design and development to hiring, management, and fundraising. He designed the initial mockups in Adobe XD and planned the product development roadmap and technology stack. After writing job descriptions and hiring the development team, he personally developed the Unity application while managing a full-stack engineering team of six professionals.

## Blockchain Innovation and Web3 Leadership

In recent years, Grig has emerged as a thought leader in the blockchain space, focusing particularly on applications that empower creators. His engagement with blockchain technology began with Chia, where his contributions were recognized with a $60,000 grant to develop Mintr, a tool for managing and minting NFT collections.

True to his open-source ethos, Grig completed all code requirements before payment and released the tool for free. He fulfilled the grant requirements prior to receiving payment and made the tool freely available to the community, with plans to continue its development and maintain its accessibility.

His technical contributions have substantially advanced NFT standards through his work on CHIP-0015 and CHIP-0021, which introduced enhanced metadata capabilities and pioneered the concept of Composable NFTs. As he explained in his Chia 3rd year mainnet speech, CHIP-0015 enhances NFT metadata by enabling rich, structured data that unlocks new possibilities for discoverability and interoperability, while CHIP-0021 introduces the groundbreaking concept of Composable NFTs, allowing for the trustless combination, division, and upgrading of digital assets on-chain.

Composable NFTs represent a significant innovation in digital asset management, enabling artists to build upon each other's work while ensuring proper attribution and compensation. They function as modular digital assets that can be mixed, matched, and transformed to create new, unique NFTs with their own properties and value. This technology points toward new possibilities for collaborative creation in digital environments, allowing creators to remix and transform existing assets while maintaining transparent royalty distribution to all contributors.

Grig's leadership extends to significant roles in the metaverse standards community. As co-chair at the Metaverse Standards Forum, he leads the Digital Assets Management Working Group, responsible for identifying interoperability needs across different metaverse implementations. In this capacity, he authored and deployed the Metaverse Metadata Directory (MVMD.org), establishing frameworks for interoperability between different metaverse platforms and standards.

The Metaverse Metadata Directory represents Grig's contribution to solving interoperability challenges in the metaverse ecosystem. It enables various standards to work together, allowing content from different formats (including Pixar and other 3D standards) to be combined in defining the foundational elements of metaverse environments.

His blockchain projects include the "Trashformers," a sold-out NFT collection featuring composable 3D objects built around an elaborate narrative universe. The collection, which sold out immediately upon release, utilizes composable 3D objects and incorporates an extensive backstory that Grig developed over the course of a year, reflecting his interest in integrating narrative elements with NFT technology to create cohesive creative universes.

This project, which combines technical innovation with creative storytelling, includes a 25-chapter book written by Grig and plans for children's books, audiobooks, and potentially film adaptations or metaverse games. He hopes to publish the full book and develop children's books featuring the Trashformers concept—robots made of trash exploring the universe. He's also working on an audiobook version using AI voice technology and envisions potential adaptation to film formats in the future.

Another significant project is Fusion, a technology developed for the successful "Monkey Zoo" NFT project on the Chia blockchain. Fusion enables NFT assets to be merged together to create new NFTs, with peer-to-peer trading capabilities for the resulting assets.

These blockchain innovations reflect Grig's consistent focus on empowering creators through technology, creating systems that enable new forms of collaboration, ownership, and monetization while preserving artistic autonomy and fair compensation. His work in this space continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in digital creativity, pointing toward a future where technology serves rather than exploits creative communities.

## Distributed Creatives: Vision and Implementation

As Executive Director and Co-Founder of Distributed Creatives, Grig leads multiple initiatives aimed at transforming the creative economy through technological innovation and community empowerment. His vision for this nonprofit organization synthesizes his decades of experience as both creator and technologist, addressing the systemic inequities that have limited artists' ability to sustain themselves through their work.

Grig's vision centers on returning ownership to creators, who have received diminishing shares of proceeds as platforms prioritize shareholder interests over artist compensation. He believes this corporate-focused climate has resulted in the loss of substantial creative work and potential, creating a widening gap between artists and viable economic opportunities.

Distributed Creatives aims to address this gap through multiple interconnected initiatives, each leveraging technology to create more equitable systems for creative expression and monetization. The organization's flagship projects include:

**Musely.social** is designed as a free alternative to traditional social media and creator platforms. Musely has been a dream of Grig’s for years, and is conceived as a unified application serving all types of creators with a perpetually free model. While communicating the concept of 100% profit return to creators presents challenges, Grig believes users will quickly recognize the value proposition.

The platform aims to replace extractive models used by companies like Spotify, Ticketmaster, Etsy, Bandcamp, YouTube, Patreon, OpenSea—all of which Grig considers to take excessive percentages from creators. Instead, Musely offers integrated services for ticketing, tipping, donations, membership sales similar to Patreon, newsletter distribution, cross-posting to other social media platforms, Fediverse integration, digital file sales, job boards, group forums for community communication, a marketplace similar to Etsy, and advertising capabilities.

**The Local Artist Network** connects physical and digital spaces, initially launching in Boulder, Colorado. The initiative emerged partly from Grig's community environmental work, including creek cleanup projects. The Local Artist Network enables artists to connect with their communities by showcasing work on digital signage and through an event network, allowing them to stream media and promote events at various locations throughout a city.

The network will launch with approximately thirty screens throughout Boulder, with plans for expansion to other cities. The initial phase targets existing venue partnerships in Boulder, aiming to increase visitor traffic and foster community engagement. The business model includes a sponsorship component limited to 10% of content, which Grig projects could generate millions in annual revenue.

**Forever Sites** leverages blockchain and distributed storage technologies to preserve creative legacies. The initiative envisions digital permanence where creators can be confident their work will have lasting impact and recognition beyond their lifetimes, with provenance, royalty structures, licensing terms, and creative lineage preserved through blockchain records.

This project addresses the critical problem of digital impermanence, where valuable creative works are lost to "the digital void" through platform shutdowns, technological obsolescence, and inadequate archiving. The proposed solution extends beyond distributed digital networks to include physical preservation through long-term media like thousand-year CD-ROMs stored in underground vaults, with aspirational plans for space-based backups to ensure preservation even in worst-case planetary scenarios.

**"The Show"** is conceived as a globally broadcast series showcasing diverse creators. Envisioned as a variety show featuring diverse creative talent reaching global audiences, the concept resembles late-night television formats but with a specific focus on creators and a more modern approach. Rather than limiting content to studio appearances, the show would include on-location segments featuring artists in their working environments.

The initiative aims to provide visibility and professional exposure through this contemporary variety show format, with content distributed through Distributed Creatives' social media platform and other channels like YouTube. With sufficient adoption, Grig believes this program could independently fund the nonprofit's operations.

These initiatives reflect Grig's comprehensive vision for transforming the creative economy—a vision grounded in his extensive experience as both creator and technologist. His approach emphasizes direct relationships between artists and audiences, sustainable revenue models that prioritize creator autonomy, and technological infrastructure that serves creative communities rather than extracting value from them.
