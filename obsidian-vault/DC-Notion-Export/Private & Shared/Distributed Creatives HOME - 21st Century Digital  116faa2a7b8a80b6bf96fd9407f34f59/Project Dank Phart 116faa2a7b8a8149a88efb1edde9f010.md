About to head off to my job but wanted to share a quick thought about my limited edition digital artifacts. I'll be airdropping all kinds of content to my collectors. Hand written pieces, unreleased pieces, exclusive behind the scenes content, flyers, posters. With a successful art brand all this will be incredibly valuable and is created as an organic process of the art business. So I  can just give it to my fans collect a little bit of royalties and they sell it on primary market. Build it so they get royalties on it as well.
