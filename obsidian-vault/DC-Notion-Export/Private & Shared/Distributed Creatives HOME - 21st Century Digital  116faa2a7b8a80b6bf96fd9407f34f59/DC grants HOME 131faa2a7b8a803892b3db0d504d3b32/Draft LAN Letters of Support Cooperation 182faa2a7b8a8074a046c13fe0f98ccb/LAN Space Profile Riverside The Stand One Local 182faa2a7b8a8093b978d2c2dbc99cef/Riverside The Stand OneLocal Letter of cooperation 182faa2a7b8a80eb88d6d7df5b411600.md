# Riverside/The Stand/OneLocal: Letter of cooperation and support for Distributed Creative’s Local Artist Network

[LETTERHEAD]
Date: January 21, 2025

To Whom It May Concern:

As the operators of Riverside, The Stand, and One Boulder - a multifaceted community hub that has served Boulder's creative ecosystem for over 23 years - we enthusiastically endorse Distributed Creative’s Local Artist Network (LAN) initiative. Since opening our doors in 2000, we have hosted over 31,000 events ranging from poetry readings and live music to cultural fusion nights and community gatherings, giving us unique insight into both the challenges and opportunities within Boulder's cultural landscape.

Our experience has shown that while Boulder possesses incredible creative energy, there are significant barriers to connecting artists with audiences and venues with patrons. The post-COVID environment has particularly highlighted the need for innovative solutions to event discovery and community engagement. This is where we see LAN playing a transformative role.

The LAN initiative directly addresses several critical challenges we've observed. Their digital signage network will dramatically improve event visibility and awareness, while their integrated ticketing and streaming capabilities will make cultural experiences more accessible to diverse audiences. As venue operators, we're particularly excited about LAN's ability to facilitate cross-venue collaboration and event coordination, which aligns perfectly with our vision of a more connected cultural community.

We see multiple synergies between LAN's infrastructure and our existing operations. Their smart display system would enhance our street presence while providing a dynamic platform for showcasing local artists. The multi-venue streaming capabilities would allow us to participate in coordinated cultural events across Boulder, amplifying the impact of our programming. Additionally, LAN's integration with platforms like Musely would streamline our event management and expand our reach within the creative community.

What particularly impresses us about LAN is its holistic approach to community building. As an organization that values connection and cultural vitality, we appreciate how LAN's technology serves a broader mission of strengthening Boulder's creative ecosystem. The platform's ability to facilitate direct artist support, enable cross-venue collaboration, and enhance audience engagement aligns perfectly with our own goals of fostering a more vibrant, interconnected community.

We are committed to actively participating in the LAN network through multiple display installations, live event streaming, and cross-venue programming. Our spaces would serve as key nodes in the network, leveraging our central location and diverse event experience to help realize LAN's vision of a more connected cultural landscape.

Based on our extensive experience in Boulder's cultural scene, we believe LAN represents a crucial step forward in addressing the challenges facing our creative community. The initiative's focus on technological innovation in service of community connection and cultural vitality makes it an essential addition to Boulder's cultural infrastructure.

We strongly endorse LAN and look forward to being active participants in this exciting evolution of Boulder's cultural landscape.

Sincerely,
