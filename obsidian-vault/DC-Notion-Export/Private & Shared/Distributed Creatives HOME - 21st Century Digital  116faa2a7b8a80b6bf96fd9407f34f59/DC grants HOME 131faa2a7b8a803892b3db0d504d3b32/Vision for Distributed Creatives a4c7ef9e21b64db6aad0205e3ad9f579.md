# Vision for Distributed Creatives

The end goal for Distributed Creatives is to be a global digital infrastructure, that is distributed and governed locally, which provides the framework for a creative economy that becomes the backbone of the global economy ushering in a new era upon planet earth. 

We will get there by launching our beta test in Boulder, CO consistently a top 10 creative community in the U.S., our target demographic of individuals aged 25 to 65 earning $50,000 to $150,000 annually. Yet, local artists and venues struggle to connect with active audiences. Distributed Creatives fills this gap, offering a dedicated platform for seamless artist-venue-audience engagement and monetization within this vibrant creative ecosystem.

Matty Bovard one of the co-founders has lived there for 13 years as a working poet developing community and relationships to support a project in this scope. 

As a city and county we have total market of 181,279

- **Total Addressable Market (TAM):**
    - Boulder City: 47,941 individuals (36% of population)
    - Boulder County: 96,338 individuals (72.4% of population)
    - University Students: 37,000 students
    - Total TAM: 181,279 individuals

With only 3,000 members at $10 a month we as an organization we will be fully self sustaining while contributing $19,500 into the local creative ecosystem every single month. We believe we can achieve this within 6 months of launch by weaving the entire community together with our digital signage and guerilla art in the streets. With both of these angles we will be the talk of the town and that is the best marketing you can get. One of the reasons we have chosen Boulder is that a city of its size is small enough to make the whole city aware of the brand yet large enough to sustain a working model. It’s government is much easier to build a relationship with and we can really understand our systems and mechanics before we work with larger cities which will be much more resource intensive. 

With our vast resource investment directly into the community it will attract more members. 

Membership supported media is already a proven model with community radio. People don’t contribute to community radio because they make a financial return. It’s a cultural return. With our platform we will be putting this all on hyper drive. 

Within the year we’ll expand to all of Boulder County. As we move into year two we will begin preparations to grow into the Denver Metro area. Along with developing relationships with creative communities across the globe. We envision that are tools can be made available to marginalized communities across the planet to develop their own mirco economies based on their creative work which can plug into the global lattice of distributed networks of creative communities that are self governing. 

We believe that art and creativity in all it’s facets can uplift all of humanity out of it’s current struggles to give each individual agency and inspiration to live their best life. 

Our 5 year goal is to have multiple hubs on every continent and the rise of the creative class as an economic force can be seen across every sector of  life. The United States will be a hot bed of creative output unlike the world has ever seen. Each community will be self funded. 

Our 10 year goal is that Distributed Creatives and it’s projects have enabled art to become a top 10 economic sector in terms of sheer market volume. This will be achieved while keeping the creators in control of their work and IP. As an organization we have millions of monthly paying members with the majority of the funds going into the community in a variety of ways. 

Distributed Creatives has become a global network that provides the backbone for the creative economy while empowering local governance and relationships with resources. As a non-profit we will have paved a new way of doing business that brings business into alignment with organic patterns of life in a prosperous manner instead of an extractive manner. 

Over the next 50 years an art revolution takes place and the war is won without a single bullet fired. It’s an undertaking and not an overtaking. Life is liberated to flourish in all it’s wild glory.
