Dear Summit Grant Strategies,

We assembled this in an attempt to make a complete version for the application in the correct format using the other documents that we have prepared. 

We then went through this and added some notes during a meeting but it wasnâ€™t added into the main copy. 

My hope is to add the most essential stuff in the next day. Which I believe is, the bios for the Board of Directors and any additional details in the bottom of most sections. 

Not all of it is going to be something we can assemble soon enough. I'll be working on this most of the time on Tuesday Feb 11. I am assuming we don't have any time on February 12 to complete it. Sorry about the tight deadline.

-Grig

# Scored Panel Questions with character limit accounted for

- Capacity (1250 character limit)
    
    This grant will significantly enhance the capacity of Distributed Creatives by enabling the installation of our first two Local Artists Network (LAN) digital signage systems at key venues. These installations mark a crucial step in executing our strategic plan, as they establish a sustainable revenue stream through sponsorship opportunities while simultaneously building our initial user base of artists, audiences, and businesses. By integrating digital signage into high-traffic venues, we will amplify visibility for local artists, connecting them with broader Boulder communities and driving increased attendance at creative events. This increased engagement strengthens the creative economy by fostering deeper connections between artists and local businesses. Additionally, the infrastructure provided by this grant supports long-term sustainability by demonstrating a repeatable model for expanding LAN to new locations. These initial installations serve as proof of concept, showcasing the value of community-driven digital infrastructure that enhances cultural participation, economic opportunity, and creative collaboration.
    
- Community Priorities (1800 character limit)
    
    Distributed Creatives directly aligns with Boulderâ€™s Community Cultural Plan by fostering a thriving creative ecosystem that supports artists, engages the community, and strengthens Boulderâ€™s identity as a cultural hub. Our Local Artists Network (LAN) digital signage initiative and Musely Social Media platform enhances access to essential digital tools for creatives, empowering them to build sustainable careers while keeping more revenue in their pockets. As a nonprofit, we provide these tools for free, ensuring that financial barriers do not prevent artists from reaching wider audiences and growing their careers.
    
    By launching this revolutionary initiative for creatives locally, our project helps make Boulder a beacon of what a thriving 21st-century creative community can look like. Our installations will feature dedicated screen time for underrepresented voices, ensuring a more inclusive representation of the cityâ€™s diverse cultural landscape. This initiative contributes directly to adding creativity in the public realm and engaging undeserved communities in artistic expression.
    
    Additionally, we foster a culture of support and engagement by building an active audience that values and contributes to the local creative economy. Our ongoing community outreach across all sectors ensures that our platform evolves in direct response to the needs of Boulderâ€™s artists and residents. Through this, we not only strengthen the city's creative infrastructure but also create new pathways for civic dialogue, artistic collaboration, and career development, reinforcing Boulderâ€™s identity as a vibrant cultural destination.
    
- Evaluation Strategy (1250 character limit)
    
    Our evaluation strategy will track key metrics that demonstrate our impact in building an empowered creative economy. We will measure success through the number of creators on boarded to our platform, ticket sales processed, total artist revenue generated, new members and Musely accounts created, and impressions on our LAN digital signage. These data points will provide clear insights into how our platform supports local artists and strengthens Boulderâ€™s creative economy.
    
    Beyond quantitative metrics, we will assess community impact through direct feedback from artists, venues, and audiences. We will collect surveys and host community forums to understand how our tools and initiatives are enhancing creative careers, increasing event attendance, and driving venue revenue. This qualitative feedback will help refine our approach and ensure our platform continues to meet the evolving needs of Boulderâ€™s creative community.
    
    By demonstrating measurable success, we will leverage this data to secure additional grants, sponsorships, donations, and memberships, ensuring long-term sustainability and continued growth in supporting a creative renaissance.
    
- Cultural Equity (1250 character limit)
    
    Distributed Creatives is committed to cultural equity by ensuring that underrepresented communities have direct access to resources, visibility, and opportunities within the creative economy. We actively work to engage with organizations led by marginalized groups to understand their specific needs and integrate their voices into our platform. Our digital signage initiative designates a specific percentage of screen time exclusively for these communities, amplifying their presence in Boulderâ€™s cultural landscape.
    
    Our leadership reflects our commitment to inclusivity. Among our four board members, three are over the age of 50, one is a woman, and one is an African American man. This diversity in leadership ensures that our strategic decisions reflect a broad range of lived experiences and perspectives.
    
    By fostering accessible digital tools, targeted outreach, and equitable representation, we contribute to Boulderâ€™s broader goals of racial and cultural equity. Our work supports a more just, inclusive creative sector where all creativesâ€”regardless of backgroundâ€”have the agency to thrive, reinforcing Boulder as a model for equity-driven cultural development.
    
- Encouragement Points (500 character limit)
    
    Distributed Creatives fosters a culture where art is valued for personal well-being, not just professional success. Through the Local Artists Network (LAN) and Musely, we connect the community directly with local creatives, driving event attendance and engagement. Our digital signage makes the arts more visible, encouraging participation at all levels. By supporting creativity for its own sake, we empower individuals to explore art as a tool for expression, connection, and mental well-being.
    

# **1. ORGANIZATION BACKGROUND**

Distributed Creatives was founded in 2024 to address fundamental challenges faced by creatives in developing sustainable economic opportunities in the digital age. Its founding team comprises artists who have worked extensively in their own creative careers and intimately understand the problems facing independent creators.

Drawing from over 13 years of experience working in Boulder's local art community and regional music festivals, the organization identified a critical gap between available digital tools and actual sustainable outcomes for artists. While many platforms offer ways to publish and promote creative work, few provide the comprehensive infrastructure needed for artists to build sustainable careers.

The organization was deliberately established as a nonprofit to ensure that infrastructure for the creative economy could be developed as a public good rather than a commercial enterprise. This decision stemmed from recognizing that profit-driven platforms often create extractive relationships with creators, taking significant portions of their earnings while providing limited support for career development.

Distributed Creatives differentiates itself by focusing on weaving together both digital and physical infrastructure through initiatives like the Local Artist Network (LAN) and Musely social platform. These tools are designed to build resilient creative ecosystems that connect artists, venues, and audiences in meaningful ways while ensuring creators maintain control of their work and earnings.

- Alternative Organizational background incorporating feedback from 1 and 2 below
    
    Founded in 2024, Distributed Creatives emerged to tackle one of the most pressing challenges of our timeâ€”how creatives can build sustainable careers in an era where digital platforms increasingly extract value from their work rather than support it. Unlike traditional commercial platforms that prioritize profit over creator well-being, Distributed Creatives is structured as a nonprofit, ensuring that the infrastructure of the creative economy is developed as a public good rather than an exploitative marketplace. Its founding team consists of artists with deep firsthand experience navigating the struggles of independent creation. With over 13 years of involvement in Boulderâ€™s art community and regional music festivals, they recognized a critical gap: while digital tools for publishing and promotion abound, few provide the economic infrastructure necessary for artists to thrive. Distributed Creatives was launched to bridge this gapâ€”creating systems that empower artists to control their work, revenue, and audience relationships without reliance on extractive intermediaries.
    
    In its first months, Distributed Creatives has already built a strong foundation, demonstrating the viability and urgency of its mission. Musely, its social platform for creatives, is fully operational and ready to onboard initial users in an invite-only launch to cultivate a thriving community before a broader rollout. Minting tools for composable NFTs have been developed and deployed, offering provenance, lifetime royalties, and limitless remixabilityâ€”giving artists financial sustainability and cultural innovation. The organization has intentionally structured its infrastructure using off-the-shelf software, ensuring rapid scalability while maintaining low overhead. With its server already running and two venues signed on for the Local Artists Network (LAN), Distributed Creatives is actively building both digital and physical spaces where artists can connect with audiences and earn a living. These venues will not only host organizational pages within Musely but also serve as hubs for live events, including stakeholder round tables, immersive art experiences, film screenings, open mics, and industry nights. With a strong base of artists eager to participate in the pilot phase, the organization is leveraging deep community ties and strategic partnerships to expand its reach. Additionally, the first major event under the Distributed Creatives umbrella, eARTh pARTy Conference a *Creative Culture & Tech Conference*, is set for July 11-13, 2025, in the Sacramento Delta, bringing together thought leaders to discuss the future of digital ownership, creative ecosystems, and regenerative cultural development.
    
    Now more than ever, the need for Distributed Creatives is clear. Creative collectives are being dismantled, leaving artists without essential support networks. The increasing dominance of corporate platforms has shifted control away from users, leading to diminishing payouts for creators, as seen with Spotify. AI is rapidly reshaping the creative economy, often exploiting artists' work without fair compensation. Distributed Creatives is actively addressing these challenges by developing Forever Sites, a feature that ensures human-made creations are permanently preserved while allowing AI models to access them under fair terms. By weaving together digital and physical infrastructure, Distributed Creatives is laying the foundation for a resilient creative economy where creatives and their communities can thrive on their own terms.
