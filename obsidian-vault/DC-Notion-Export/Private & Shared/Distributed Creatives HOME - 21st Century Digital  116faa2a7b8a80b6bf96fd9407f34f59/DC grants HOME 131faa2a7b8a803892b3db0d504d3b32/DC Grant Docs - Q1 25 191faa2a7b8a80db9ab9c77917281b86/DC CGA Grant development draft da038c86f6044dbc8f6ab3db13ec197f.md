### **Section I: Cover Letter**

---

Distributed Creatives respectfully requests funding to support the launch of our organization, which is dedicated to fostering a sustainable and inclusive creative economy in Boulder. With a team that has members who have spent the past 13 years working in Boulder’s local art community and regional music festivals, Distributed Creatives brings deep-rooted experience and connections to this mission.

Our launch begins with the development of the Local Artist Network (LAN), a digital signage platform that will connect artists, venues, and audiences across Boulder. The LAN will serve as the foundation for a broader effort to empower local creatives to develop sustainable careers through networking opportunities and, over time, direct investments from our organization.

Diversity and inclusivity are core to our mission. We aim to ensure representation across age groups, ethnic backgrounds, and socioeconomic statuses in all our programs. For those with limited capacity for in-person events, the LAN will provide access to creative offerings from the comfort of home, while also amplifying local voices through live performances and art displays.

This grant will enable Distributed Creatives to bring our vision to life, establish a connected creative ecosystem, and create long-term benefits for Boulder’s vibrant creative community. Thank you for considering our application.

    - **Cultural Impact:** LAN will contribute to a flourishing art ecosystem in Boulder, creating pathways for artists to earn a living and fostering a deeper appreciation for local creativity.
