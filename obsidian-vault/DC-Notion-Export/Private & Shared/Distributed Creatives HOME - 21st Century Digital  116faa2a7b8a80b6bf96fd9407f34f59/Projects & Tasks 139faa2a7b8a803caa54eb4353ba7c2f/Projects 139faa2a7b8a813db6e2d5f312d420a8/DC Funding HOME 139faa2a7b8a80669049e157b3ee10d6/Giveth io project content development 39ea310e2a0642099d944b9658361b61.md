# What is Distributed Creatives?

Distributed Creatives is a non-profit with a mission to develop the digital infrastructure for a 21st Century art economy as a public vs a commercial enterprise. There are 5 core projects of the organization. 

## These 5 projects are:

1. **The Local Artist Network (LAN):** This aims to create a digital overlay of real world art economies to network and enable commerce between artists, art enthusiasts and art related businesses. We will be launching our beta version for this right here in Boulder. Once the model is perfected it will develop nodes around the rest of CO and in time the globe. 
2. **The Metaverse**: We will explore ways to establish standards, foster community, and build an artists' economy in the virtual world.
3. **The Chain of Creators**: A cutting-edge NFT technology that enables each layer of digital content to be made into its own NFT. This allows it to be remixed with any other NFT while tracking intellectual property and paying artists royalties for usage.
4. **The Show**: A variety show that interviews artists and is broadcast online and via digital signage installed by Distributed Creatives at venues throughout the community. This signage and show become a social glue that weaves the living art economy together. Each node in the LAN will have it’s own version that can be streamed by any venue in the network connecting the nodes in global lattice of interdependent art scenes.
5. **The Fediverse**: The cutting-edge of social networking that distributes content across platforms built with the same digital infrastructure. This allows artists to bring their audiences with them across platforms. No longer being constrained to a single platform that owns your audience.

# Why Distributed Creatives?

Art is a human right—an expression of humanity’s lifeblood that has long been stifled by commercial constraints, forcing artists into a starving archetype and limiting their creative freedom. Distributed Creatives envisions a 21st-century renaissance, where art thrives as a public good rather than a commercial enterprise. By leveraging modern technology, we are building an ecosystem powered from the bottom up, creating interdependent art nodes that foster thriving local art economies while connecting them to a global network. This infrastructure empowers artists to create on their own terms, connect directly with audiences, and build enriching experiences that foster community and break down barriers. Our mission is to liberate art from extractive systems, transforming it into a cornerstone of a regenerative economy, where technology enhances authentic connection and art flows freely as the vital force that unites and uplifts humanity.

# How funds will be used?

Funds raised for Distributed Creatives will initially support the team in developing and launching the platform. Once operational, a significant percentage of funds will be dedicated to supporting artists through grants and sponsorships, fostering a thriving creative ecosystem. We are committed to full transparency, publishing quarterly reports detailing how funds are used and distributed. As the platform grows, it will become self-sustaining through memberships, optional tips on purchases, and fees from for-profit businesses using the platforms tools to operate their services. Artists will always receive 100% of their sales, with an option to voluntarily contribute a percentage to the organization. This model empowers independent creatives while building a positive feedback loop: a flourishing platform financially supports the next generation of artists, whose success further sustains the platform. By keeping the platform free and focusing on its tangible impact, we invite community support to sustain a vibrant and independent art culture.

# Launch Plan

We will be launching in the creative mecca of Boulder, CO where our team has deep roots in the local and regional art scene. From here we will be able to perfect the product to create a thriving local art economy that empowers creators with the tools to build a working and an active engaged audience to connect with that will purchase their work. With this foundation we will expand to cities all across Colorado then nationwide and eventually globally. 

The launch of Distributed Creatives is set for late Spring 2025. Leading up to this, in Winter 2025, we will engage the Boulder community through outreach to artists, art-related businesses, and art enthusiasts. During this time, we’ll conduct round tables with these key demographics to gather feedback and ensure we’re building tools that truly meet their needs. This collaborative approach ensures the platform is designed to empower and serve the art community effectively from the start.

### **What is Distributed Creatives?**

Distributed Creatives is a nonprofit with a mission to develop the digital infrastructure for a 21st-century art economy—one designed as a **public good** rather than a commercial enterprise. We envision a world where artists thrive on their own terms, art flows freely as a vital cultural force, and technology amplifies creativity rather than exploiting it.

Art is a human right and a cornerstone of community. For too long, it has been stifled by extractive systems that limit creative freedom. Our solution is to build an interconnected ecosystem of local art economies—powered by blockchain and decentralized tools—that empower artists to directly connect with audiences, sustain their craft, and spark a **global renaissance of creativity.**

---

### **Our Core Projects**

We are launching **five interconnected initiatives** that redefine how art is created, shared, and sustained:

### **1. The Local Artist Network (LAN)**

The LAN is a digital overlay that mirrors and enhances real-world art economies. It connects artists, art enthusiasts, and businesses through tools for direct sales, crowdfunding, networking, and event promotion.

- **Beta Launch in Boulder, CO**: Our pilot program will create a thriving local art economy in Boulder, connecting creators to their communities. Once perfected, the model will expand to nodes across Colorado and, eventually, the world.
- **Real-World Impact**: Artists can host events, sell work directly, and crowdfund projects—all without losing income to intermediaries. Enthusiasts can easily discover and support local creators, building a robust cultural ecosystem.

---

### **2. The Metaverse**

We are developing standards and tools to bring art into virtual spaces. From digital galleries to immersive experiences, this project explores how artists can thrive in the metaverse:

- **Virtual Galleries**: Artists can display and sell their work in dynamic 3D spaces that transcend the limitations of physical geography.
- **Community Ownership**: By integrating blockchain, creators retain control of their work and receive fair royalties for every virtual transaction.
- **Global Reach**: Expand the accessibility of art by connecting metaverse audiences with real-world creators.

---

### **3. The Chain of Creators**

This is a revolutionary **NFT (Non-Fungible Token)** system that empowers collaboration while ensuring artists are always compensated.

- **Layer-by-Layer Ownership**: Each layer of a digital creation—such as a beat, illustration, or animation—can be turned into an NFT. This allows works to be remixed while tracking intellectual property and paying royalties automatically to every contributor.
- **Royalty Integrity**: Blockchain technology ensures that payments are transparent, fair, and perpetual, even as the work evolves over time.

---

### **4. The Show**

A variety show that highlights artists through interviews, performances, and live demonstrations. The show will be broadcast online and via digital signage installed by Distributed Creatives in venues throughout the community.

- **Social Glue for Art Economies**: The signage connects LAN nodes, building visibility for artists while fostering deeper audience engagement.
- **Global Network of Shows**: Each LAN node will host its own version of the show, streamed worldwide. This creates a global tapestry of interdependent art scenes that amplify local voices.

---

### **5. The Fediverse**

The Fediverse is a cutting-edge decentralized social networking system that liberates creators from the constraints of platform ownership.

- **Control Your Audience**: Artists can bring their followers with them across different platforms, no longer tied to the whims of a single platform.
- **Interoperability**: Built with the same digital infrastructure as the LAN, the Fediverse ensures seamless integration with all tools within the Distributed Creatives ecosystem.
- **Empowering Communication**: Artists can share updates, content, and collaborations without middlemen, retaining ownership and control.

---

### **Why Distributed Creatives?**

By building infrastructure for the **art economy as a public good**, we break the cycle of exploitation that has defined the creative industries for too long. Our model empowers:

- **Artists**: They retain full ownership of their work, earn directly from sales and royalties, and access tools to grow their audiences.
- **Art Enthusiasts**: They connect with creators in meaningful ways, discovering and supporting art that enriches their lives.
- **Communities**: By fostering thriving local art economies, Distributed Creatives strengthens cultural bonds and economic resilience.
- **Creator Profiles:** Talent discovery, booking management, search by region, event ticketing, donations, tipping, subscriptions, NFT sales, and fediverse integration

With your help, we can build an art economy rooted in **fairness, transparency, and regeneration.**

---

### **How Funds Will Be Used**

Funds raised will directly support the development and launch of Distributed Creatives' platform. Specifically, they will:

1. **Support Development**: Build tools like the LAN and Chain of Creators, ensuring they meet the needs of the art community.
2. **Launch Beta in Boulder, CO**: Host round tables, engage local stakeholders, and implement the first functional LAN node.
3. **Support Artists Directly**: Provide grants and sponsorships to help artists create, showcase, and sell their work.

We are committed to full transparency, publishing quarterly reports detailing fund allocation and impact. Our sustainable revenue model—through memberships, optional tips, and fees from for-profit businesses—ensures the platform remains free for artists while generating ongoing support for the art community.

---

### **Launch Plan**

Our journey begins in Boulder, CO, a hub of creativity and innovation where our team has deep roots. In **Winter 2025**, we will:

- **Host Round Tables**: Engage artists, businesses, and enthusiasts to refine our platform and tailor it to their needs.
- **Build Community Excitement**: Showcase early prototypes and gather feedback to ensure our tools deliver maximum impact.

The official beta launch of Distributed Creatives is planned for **Spring 2025**. From there, we’ll expand to cities across Colorado, scale nationally, and eventually grow into a **global network of thriving local art economies.**

---

### **Why Now?**

Art holds the power to unite, heal, and inspire. By liberating it from extractive systems, we can transform it into a regenerative force that uplifts humanity.

Join us on this journey to create the future of art. Together, we can empower creators, enrich communities, and build a global ecosystem where art thrives as a public good.
