- Solution Overview
- Technical Details (or Methodology)
- Case Studies/Benefits
- Implementation
- Conclusion
- Appendices (if any)
- References

Introduction:

- Briefly introduce the topic or technology.
- Explain why it's relevant now.

Executive Summary:

- Summarize the key points of the white paper.
- Highlight the problem, solution, and benefits.

Problem Statement:

- Detail the issue or challenge that the white paper addresses.

Appendices:

- Additional data, charts, or technical information that supports the main text but isn't critical for the main argument.

References:

- List all sources, data, or previous works cited in your white paper.

Design and Visuals:

- Headers and Footers: Include page numbers, document title, or company logo.
- Visuals: Use graphs, charts, and images to break text and illustrate points. Ensure they are relevant and high-quality.
- Color Scheme: Choose a professional color scheme that reflects the tone of your white paper (e.g., for technology, blues and greys might be appropriate).
- Typography: Use readable fonts with clear headings and subheadings.

Interactive Elements (if digital):

- Links to further reading or resources.

Call to Action:

- At the end or as a sidebar, include what you want readers to do next (e.g., contact for more information, download a tool, sign up for a newsletter).

This template can be adjusted based on the specific content or industry. For instance, if your white paper is more technical like the Chia Network's, you might expand on the technical details section with more diagrams and technical specifications. For a more general business or solution-focused white paper, you might emphasize case studies and benefits more.

Remember, the key to a compelling white paper is not just the information but how it's presented. Keep the language accessible yet authoritative, and ensure that design elements support rather than distract from the content.
