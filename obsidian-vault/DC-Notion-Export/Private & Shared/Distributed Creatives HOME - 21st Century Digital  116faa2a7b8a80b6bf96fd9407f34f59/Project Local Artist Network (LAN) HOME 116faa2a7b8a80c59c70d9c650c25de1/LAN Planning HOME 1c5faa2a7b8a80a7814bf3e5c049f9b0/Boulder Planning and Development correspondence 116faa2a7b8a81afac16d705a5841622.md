Subject: Inquiry Regarding Sign Permits for Digital Displays in Boulder

Dear Boulder City Officials,

I represent a non-profit organization that aims to connect artists with the Boulder community. We are considering the use of digital displays in local businesses to showcase art, stream events photos, and display calendar information. After reviewing Boulder's Sign Code ([https://bouldercolorado.gov/services/sign-code](https://bouldercolorado.gov/services/sign-code)), we would like to clarify whether our proposed displays would require sign permits.

Our proposed displays would:

1. Show still images and text, changing slowly (similar to a screensaver)
2. Not use flashing graphics or rapid motion
3. Be placed in two potential configurations:
a. A 15" computer monitor on the inside window ledge of a business, facing the street at knee height, visible to pedestrians
b. A 50" TV mounted on the back wall of a business, approximately 10 feet from street-facing windows

We are not affiliated with any specific business at this time; the location mentioned in our submission form is merely representative of the types of venues we hope to engage.

Given these specifications, could you please advise:

1. Would either or both of these display configurations require a sign permit?
2. Are there any additional regulations or considerations we should be aware of?

Thank you for your time and guidance in this matter.

Sincerely,

Grig Bilham

Artists Renaissance Network
