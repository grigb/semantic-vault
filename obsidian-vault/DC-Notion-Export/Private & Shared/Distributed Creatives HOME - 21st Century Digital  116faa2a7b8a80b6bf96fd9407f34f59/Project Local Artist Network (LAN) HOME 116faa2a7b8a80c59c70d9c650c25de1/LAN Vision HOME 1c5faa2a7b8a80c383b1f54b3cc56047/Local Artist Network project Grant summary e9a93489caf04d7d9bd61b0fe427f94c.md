# Local Artist Network: Revolutionizing Community Ecosystems for Creatives

**Project details:** [distributedcreatives.org/lan](https://distributedcreatives.org/lan)

## Project Overview

The Local Artist Network (LAN) is an innovative initiative designed to transform how communities engage with art, launching in Boulder, Colorado. By leveraging cutting-edge digital signage technology and fostering connections between artists, venues, and art enthusiasts, the LAN creates a vibrant, interconnected ecosystem that celebrates local creativity and drives economic growth.

## Core Components

- **Live Streaming Capabilities:** Enabling real-time broadcasts of performances and events across the network from participating venues, and live streaming platforms.
- **Creator Profiles:** Talent discovery, booking management, search by region, event ticketing, donations, tipping, subscriptions, NFT sales, and fediverse integration

## Benefits and Impact

### For Artists:

- Increased visibility and exposure to local audiences
- Direct connection with fans and potential buyers
- Opportunities for collaboration and professional development
- Sustainable income through sponsored performances and art sales

### For Venues:

## Technological Innovation

The Local Artist Network combines low-cost digital signage displays, a creator-first social network, custom smart TV apps, and cutting-edge streaming technologies for multicasting. This innovative approach seamlessly integrates local creators into public spaces, fosters direct artist-audience connections, and supports high-quality live event streaming. By harnessing these technologies, the LAN creates a dynamic, accessible platform for showcasing and experiencing local creators. The public is encouraged to support creators directly through the website via QR codes and creator profiles.

- **Phase 3:** Roll out nationally, establish interconnected LANs, and implement cross-city collaborations⁠
- **Phase 4:** Begin global expansion, fostering cross-cultural artistic exchange and partnerships⁠⁠
- **Phase 5:** Create worldwide LAN network, integrate emerging technologies, and position as a global creative economy driver**⁠**

## Funding Objectives

Grant funding will support:

- Infrastructure development and hardware acquisition
- Software platform refinement and feature expansion
- Community outreach and artist onboarding programs
- Research into emerging technologies for future integration

By supporting the Local Artist Network, you're not just funding a project – you're investing in the future of community-driven art ecosystems, fostering creativity, driving economic growth, and enriching lives through the power of art and technology.

## **Demographics Data**

- Information on the population served by your programs, including diversity metrics.
    - **About digital signage impressions:** The LAN plans to integrate digital signage impressions for a diverse range of needs. Impressions are scheduled, displayed, managed, and tracked across all participating locations. With an average of 1440 impressions per day, the LAN can guarantee fair support of all parties
    - **Serving Local Creators:** A majority of the impressions (70% or more) are reserved for creators to display their creations. Each will link (with QR codes) to their page on the Musely (a social platform run by Distributed Creatives).
    - **Serving Tribal Nations:** Digital signage impressions showcasing the history of tribal nations in Boulder, CO, and any additional information to be supplied by the city of Boulder.
    - **Serving Youth:** Ongoing updates for youth art opportunities, such as CU Boulder, YOAB, and youth opportunities in projects

    - **Serving Alert Networks:** Support for broadcasting climate alerts
    - **Serving Sponsors:** The majority of the cost of running the LAN will be paid for by the sponsors, including public, private, and corporate. Ideally there would be support from grants and the city, but we are also planning to provide limited space to corporate sponsorship in the form of a small banner at the bottom of some impressions.

2 my honest opinion feels like 1 as all we have to do is keep doing the work and I believe it’s inevitable. The only thing that will stop me from doing this work is if I were to die. I ride with spirit on that one and it’s what brought me here so don’t expect it cut the ride any time soon. I’m like Crazy Horse riding into battle as long as I don’t fall into fear I’ll be protected.

# **(Priorities: Out of all of the projects goals and objectives related to those goals, how would you prioritize the need for action on each?)**

While all goals are high priority, here’s how they are prioritized in terms of valuation and impact, from highest to lowest, alongside the rationale for their ranking:

### **1. Funding**

**Highest Priority**

- **Why**: Securing funding is the foundation for all other objectives. Without financial resources, platform development, LAN installation, and onboarding processes cannot move forward effectively.
- **Actions**:
    - Complete grant documents and applications.
    - Develop the pitch deck for donor outreach.
    - Launch the eARTh pARTy Conference to raise funds.

---

### **2. Platform Development**

**High Priority**

- **Why**: A fully functional and user-friendly platform is essential to attract and retain users, enabling the success of LAN, closed beta, and open beta.
- **Actions**:
    - Finalize development of LAN and Musely platforms.
    - Ensure all onboarding processes are developed and tested before user onboarding begins.

---

### **3. LAN Installation**

**High Priority**

- **Why**: LAN installations in Boulder serve as a proof of concept and a cornerstone for the closed beta, connecting local artists and venues.
- **Actions**:
    - Install LAN in the two confirmed venues.
    - Continue discussions with Illegal Pete’s corporate staff to secure the third venue.

---

### **4. Closed Beta**

**Medium-High Priority**

- **Why**: The closed beta will refine the platform’s user experience and build credibility by involving respected local creators.
- **Actions**:
    - Onboard a select group of creators into the beta.
    - Develop a comprehensive onboarding process to ensure seamless integration and engagement.

---

### **5. Open Beta**

**Medium Priority**

- **Why**: The open beta will expand the user base and increase platform visibility, but it depends on the success of prior steps (funding, platform readiness, and closed beta).
- **Actions**:
    - Use insights from the closed beta to optimize the platform.
    - Launch with a large, high-profile event to maximize impact.

---

### **Key Considerations**

- **Process Development**: All onboarding processes must be fully developed and tested before the actual user onboarding begins. This ensures a smooth experience for both creators and venues.
- **Simultaneous Networking**: Networking and relationship-building efforts should continue across all phases to maintain momentum and secure future opportunities.

---

**Summary of Priority Order**:

1. **Funding**
2. **Platform Development**
3. **LAN Installation**
4. **Closed Beta**
5. **Open Beta**

By focusing on funding and platform readiness first, Distributed Creatives ensures a strong foundation for the subsequent phases of LAN installations, beta launches, and broader community engagement.
