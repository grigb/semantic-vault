# Local Artists Network

## Local Artists Network (LAN)

The Local Artist Network (LAN) represents a revolutionary approach to connecting artists, venues, and audiences through an interconnected digital signage network. At its core, LAN is designed to transform how communities engage with local artistic content by creating a visible, interactive presence throughout urban spaces. The project launches in Boulder, Colorado, leveraging the city's vibrant artistic community and progressive culture to establish a model for future expansion.

### Core Concept

The foundation of LAN is a sophisticated network of digital displays strategically placed throughout participating venues â€“ coffee shops, bars, retail stores, and other high-traffic locations. Each display becomes a window into the local creative scene, operating as part of a larger, interconnected system that amplifies the impact of every participating venue and artist.

### Digital Signage Network

The digital signage system operates as a dynamic content platform, rotating through various types of content:

- Local artist showcases with prominent QR codes linking to artist profiles
- Sponsor messages and branding
- Event promotions and schedules
- Live event streams from other venues
- Interactive content encouraging community engagement

Each display shows content in carefully timed intervals, typically one minute per item, allowing viewers sufficient time to engage with the content and interact through QR codes. The system creates a consistent branded experience across all locations, building recognition and curiosity as people encounter the displays throughout their daily routines.

### Venue Integration and Benefits

Participating venues become nodes in a cultural network that extends beyond their physical location. Key benefits include:

- Cross-promotion through other venues' displays
- Access to live-streamed events from across the network
- Increased foot traffic through event hosting
- Association with Boulder's creative community
- Revenue opportunities through ticket sales and increased patronage

### Ticketing and Event Access

LAN introduces an innovative ticketing system that transforms how people experience local events:

- Flexible ticket options (daily, weekly, monthly, and annual passes)
- Seamless access to multiple venues
- Ability to experience live events at any participating location
- Creation of "venue-hopping" culture, particularly on weekends
- Bicycle-friendly event planning encouraging sustainable transportation

### Content Programming

The network supports diverse creative expression through various event types:

- Live music performances
- Film screenings (potential partnership with festivals like Sundance)
- Poetry readings
- Art gallery openings
- Mixed-media presentations
