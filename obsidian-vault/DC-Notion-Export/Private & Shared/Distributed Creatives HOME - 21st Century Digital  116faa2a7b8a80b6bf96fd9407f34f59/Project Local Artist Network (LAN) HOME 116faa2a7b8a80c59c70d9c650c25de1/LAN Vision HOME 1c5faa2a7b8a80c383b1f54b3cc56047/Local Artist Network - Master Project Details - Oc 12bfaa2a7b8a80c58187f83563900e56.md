            Super-light and free social networking plugin for WordPress
            
        - Fediverse support with ActivityPub
- Initial prompt for the Master Project Details doc
    
    Your task is to help me flush out the local artist network concept. I have supplied a lot of project knowledge files. My hope is to create a master document in outline format with detailed paragraphs for each part of the outline that explain exactly how the project works, and how it will benefit the various types of users.
    
    Allow me to paint a picture of how I see it working.
    The local artist network is essentially a bunch of digital signage. Each sign is placed somewhere in town, for example, coffee shops and bars and store windows. It should create a desire for store owners and others to be part of it because being part of it means that you are displayed at all the other locations that are using it. Part of this means that sponsor, you can get your logo and short description listed on the digital signage. During slow times and during idle moments the digital signage shows artwork by local artists at the bottom of the art for a local artist. It will show the information about the artist and a QR code. The QR code can be scanned and it redirects to a distributed creatives social media page on their site. It's this means that people can learn more about each artist and possibly buy their art. Distributed creatives is a nonprofit entity with the goal to help creators of all types so it's not just art. It's anything else that could be displayed in digital signage form. The launch program for the digital signage will be in Boulder Colorado. Boulder has a large artist SCENE. But it also has a problem with adoption. The idea is that the digital signage will be branded in such a way that after a while people will notice the same digital signage branding in all the stores they visit and start to wonder what it's about. This brings in the sort of viral networking of awareness and branding. Part of the digital signage is to always have a call to action on almost every screen that it shows. It shows screens like a slideshow would wear each thing holds for a minute and you get a chance to take it in and possibly scan the QR code before the next thing shows on the digital signage. People can become sponsor by going to the distributed, creative home site creating an account and then, sponsoring an artist. Ideally, the sponsor will be large donors who will actually bring new artist to the platform by bringing them into the network by paying for sponsorship and thus showing off the art from that artist. The digital signage should be an automated system with creation by the distributed creative team. It is essential that people who are displaying the digital creatives local artist network land, digital signage in their venues benefit greatly from the experience. One of the larger concepts is to create a phenomenon in the Boulder, Colorado area where on weekends people can pay for a day, week and, month, yearly ticket, which will allow them to visit any of the performances that occur in the digital signage, local artist netwoPaying for ticket means that you can move between the venues without having to pay when you get to the venues. When there are multiple venues in a certain day or weekend, if you are at one of the venues that is participating, but not at the venue that is actually having the event you can actually still see the event streaming live at the other venues. The ideas that you would be able to either choose to stay at a venue and watch whatever is going to happen at that venue or actually travel between the venues to see the events liOn a good day in the weekend of Boulder, Colorado, people could ride their bikes between the venues, creating a sort of all day experience or all weekend experience. One of the things we want to do is have different types of events so one might be a series of films that are shown sort of like the Sundance festival does. In fact, we do hope to attract the Sundance festival to Boulder, Colorado by having the local artist network in pla another thing we would like to do is of course music events, poetry readings, art gallery events, if possible, pretty much everything we can think of that might gain attention that is a creator based output that could be on display. The ideas to empower the local creators by giving them an audience and then building that audience beyond Boulder, Colorado. Distributed creative has a lot of other projects which will eventually be connected to the local artist network, but the local artist network is the first project of significance to be built and promoted.
    
    Take what I have given you here and the vast amount of information in the project knowledge files and consume it all carefully, and then create a master document that outlines the vision, the technology, and the steps we will need to take in order to deploy it. In another session, we will talk about the technology behind it which will be based on a WordPress site. We will be building the technology using PHP and react to create a wait for tickets to be purchased, social media, method for uploading and transcoding add spots and information and of course creator submitted content using an upload tool that will store the data on servers and likely a AWS S3 bin. The site will be built on top of and managed by peepso plug-in and custom plug-ins. One of the primary goals is to identify everything we need so I want to create a series of master use cases for all of the different participants and then we will drill into those use cases to create unique use cases. From those cases we will d, the UX and UI  interface and make sure it is complete.
    
    Your task is to create the master outline first.
    

# Comprehensive Project Introduction

### Vision Overview

The Local Artist Network (LAN) represents a revolutionary approach to connecting artists, venues, and audiences through an interconnected digital signage network. At its core, LAN is designed to transform how communities engage with local artistic content by creating a visible, interactive presence throughout urban spaces. The project launches in Boulder, Colorado, leveraging the city's vibrant artistic community and progressive culture to establish a model for future expansion.

### Core Concept

The foundation of LAN is a sophisticated network of digital displays strategically placed throughout participating venues – coffee shops, bars, retail stores, and other high-traffic locations. Each display becomes a window into the local creative scene, operating as part of a larger, interconnected system that amplifies the impact of every participating venue and artist.

### Digital Signage Network

The digital signage system operates as a dynamic content platform, rotating through various types of content:

- Local artist showcases with prominent QR codes linking to artist profiles
- Sponsor messages and branding
- Event promotions and schedules
- Live event streams from other venues
- Interactive content encouraging community engagement

Each display shows content in carefully timed intervals, typically one minute per item, allowing viewers sufficient time to engage with the content and interact through QR codes. The system creates a consistent branded experience across all locations, building recognition and curiosity as people encounter the displays throughout their daily routines.
