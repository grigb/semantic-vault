# Refined 10-Slide Structure

Based on Guy Kawasaki's 10-slide format and the content you've provided, I can see how to refine your pitch deck for impact investors. Let me review what you have and suggest a more concise, powerful approach that will get pulses racing.

## Overall Assessment

Your content has all the right elements but needs tightening and restructuring to follow the 10-slide format exactly. The key is creating an immediate emotional connection with impact investors while demonstrating you have a viable, scalable solution to a meaningful problem.

## Refined 10-Slide Structure

### 1. Title Page

- Company name + eye image
- Motto: "Revolutionizing the Creative Economy"
- Team names and contact info
- 501(c)(3) nonprofit status prominently displayed (important for impact investors)

### 2. Problem/Opportunity (Pulse-Racer)

This needs to hit hard and fast:

- "Today's creatives are drowning in platform fragmentation and fighting a losing battle"
- Visually show the dozens of platforms a creative must manage
- Use the most powerful statistic: "$804 billion contributed to the US economy by arts and culture" juxtaposed with "Yet most individual creatives can't earn a living wage"
- Emphasize that this broken system affects culture, communities, and economic potential

### 3. Value Proposition

- Combine your philosophical statement with concrete benefits
- "We're creating an integrated ecosystem where creatives thrive on their own terms"
- Show direct benefits: consolidation of platforms, local-to-global growth, sustainable income, permanent legacy
- Impact message: "When creatives thrive, communities prosper"

### 4. Underlying Magic

This should be almost entirely visual:

- Flowcharts/diagrams showing how your four components work together
- LAN: Local venue network visual
