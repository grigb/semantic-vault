**Distributed Creatives: Empowering Artists through Grants in the Web3 Ecosystem**

Distributed Creatives  is a non-profit organization dedicated to reshaping the art economy into an equitable, community-driven, and regenerative ecosystem. As part of our mission, Distributed Creatives will operate an artist-focused grant round on Gitcoin, offering financial support to artists and art projects.  This initiative aligns with Distributed Creative’s core values of promoting art as a public good while leveraging blockchain technology to create lasting impact.

### **The Distributed Creative Artist Grant Round**

The Distributed Creatives Artist Grant Round on Gitcoin is designed to provide funding to artists and projects actively contributing to cultural and creative progress. By running this grant round, Distributed Creatives aims to:

1. **Empower Artists**: Direct financial support enables artists to continue or scale their impactful work.
2. **Expand Exposure**: Participation in Gitcoin amplifies visibility for grantees and the broader art community within the Web3 ecosystem.
3. **Foster Collaboration**: Connect artists with aligned sponsors, organizations, and communities in the decentralized world.

**How It Works:**

- **Quadratic Funding Model**: Gitcoin’s unique model ensures small contributions are amplified by matching pools, creating opportunities for grassroots movements to thrive.
- **Open Participation**: Artists across mediums—visual, digital, performance, and more—can apply, prioritizing inclusivity and diversity.
- **Aligned Sponsorships**: Distributed Creatives collaborates with Web3-focused sponsors who share our vision of empowering the creative economy.

### **Distributed Creative’s Role and Commitment**

- **Non-Profit Operation**: Distributed Creatives will make no profits from the grant round. All funds raised and matched go directly to artists and projects.
- **Brand Exposure, Not Revenue**: Our goal is to establish Distributed Creatives as a trusted facilitator in the creative Web3 ecosystem, showcasing our commitment to supporting artists first and foremost.
- **Community Building**: Running this grant round enables Distributed Creatives to tap into the Gitcoin ecosystem, fostering connections between artists, sponsors, and art enthusiasts.
