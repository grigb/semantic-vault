# What Makes Distributed Creatives Distinct (First draft)

Based on this research, Distributed Creatives has several potential differentiators:

1. **Technological Foundation**: Unlike many advocacy organizations that focus primarily on policy, Distributed Creatives integrates advocacy with practical technological solutions (distributed storage, provenance tracking, licensing frameworks).
2. **Cross-Disciplinary Integration**: While many organizations focus on specific creator categories (writers, musicians, visual artists), Distributed Creatives bridges across disciplines and also includes knowledge creators (academic, scientific).
3. **Community-Based Approach**: Your focus on connecting with real-world communities rather than just digital outreach offers a distinct advantage in building adoption.
4. **Long-term Preservation**: Few organizations specifically address the preservation of creative works for future generations as a core value.
5. **Comprehensive Framework**: Your seven principles create a more holistic view of creator needs than most organizations, which tend to focus on narrower subsets of issues.
6. **Balance Between Individual and Collective**: Your framework balances individual creator sovereignty with collective power in a way that many other organizations don't articulate as clearly.

These differentiators suggest Distributed Creatives can position itself as a comprehensive solution that addresses gaps left by other organizations while complementing their specialized advocacy work.
