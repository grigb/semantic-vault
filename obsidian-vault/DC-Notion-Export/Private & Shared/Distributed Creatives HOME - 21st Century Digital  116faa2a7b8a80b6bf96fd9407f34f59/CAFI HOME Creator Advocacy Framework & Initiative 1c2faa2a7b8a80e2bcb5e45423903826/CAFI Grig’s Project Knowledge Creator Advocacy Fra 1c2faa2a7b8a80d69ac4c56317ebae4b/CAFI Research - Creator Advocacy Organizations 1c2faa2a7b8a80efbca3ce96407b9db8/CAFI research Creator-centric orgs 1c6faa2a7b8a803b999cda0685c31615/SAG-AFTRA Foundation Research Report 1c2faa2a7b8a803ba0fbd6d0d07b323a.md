## Notes

The SAG-AFTRA Foundation offers a valuable model of an organization that maintains independence while serving a specific industry community. Their balance of immediate member support through emergency assistance with long-term development through educational programming demonstrates a holistic approach to creator advocacy.

For Distributed Creatives, the Foundation's success highlights the importance of tangible benefits that address immediate needs while building toward systemic change. Their engagement of high-profile supporters through formal council structures provides a blueprint for leveraging influence effectively.

The Foundation's rapid scaling during crises (COVID-19, industry strikes) demonstrates the importance of flexible infrastructure and clear processes. However, their model is limited by focusing exclusively on union members and primarily addressing emergency situations rather than transforming underlying systems.

Distributed Creatives has an opportunity to complement organizations like the SAG-AFTRA Foundation by focusing on cross-disciplinary solutions, technological innovation, and systemic change while collaborating with established emergency support systems rather than duplicating them.
