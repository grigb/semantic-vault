## Notes

The Creative Rights Division is not a separate formal entity but rather an integrated function within the Writers Guild of America structure. It operates primarily through committees established to address creative rights issues in different sectors of the entertainment industry. Its work is deeply connected to the broader collective bargaining activities of the WGA while maintaining a specific focus on the creative aspects of writers' work beyond just economic concerns.

The joint committees with the Directors Guild of America represent an important collaborative model for addressing creative issues that involve multiple stakeholders in the production process. This collaborative approach could be valuable for Distributed Creatives to consider as it builds relationships with other creator organizations.

The division's evolution to address new challenges like AI exploitation of writers' work demonstrates how a creator advocacy organization can adapt its core principles to new technological contexts - an important lesson for Distributed Creatives as it develops its own approach to emerging technologies.
