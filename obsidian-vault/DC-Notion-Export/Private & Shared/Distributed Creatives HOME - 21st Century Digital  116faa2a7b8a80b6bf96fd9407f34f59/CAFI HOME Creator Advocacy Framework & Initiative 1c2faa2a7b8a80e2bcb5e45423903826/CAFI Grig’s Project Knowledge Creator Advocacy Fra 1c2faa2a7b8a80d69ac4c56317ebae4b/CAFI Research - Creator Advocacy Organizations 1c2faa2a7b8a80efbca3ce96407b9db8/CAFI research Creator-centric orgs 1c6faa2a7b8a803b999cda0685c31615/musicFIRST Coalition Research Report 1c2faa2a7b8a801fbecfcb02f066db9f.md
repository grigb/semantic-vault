## Notes

musicFIRST represents an effective coalition-based advocacy model focused on a specific issue within the music industry. While its narrow focus and organizational structure differ from Distributed Creatives' broader vision, it offers valuable lessons in messaging clarity, coalition building, and policy advocacy. The complementary nature of the two organizations' missions suggests potential for collaboration, with Distributed Creatives offering technological solutions and cross-disciplinary reach that could enhance musicFIRST's specific policy objectives within the music industry.

The coalition has been successful in keeping its issue consistently in front of policymakers and has built meaningful bipartisan support for its legislative priorities. Its ability to connect high-profile artists with everyday working musicians creates a powerful narrative about the real-world impact of current policy. However, its limited direct engagement with individual creators and relatively narrow focus may restrict its broader influence compared to Distributed Creatives' vision of a cross-disciplinary creator advocacy platform.
