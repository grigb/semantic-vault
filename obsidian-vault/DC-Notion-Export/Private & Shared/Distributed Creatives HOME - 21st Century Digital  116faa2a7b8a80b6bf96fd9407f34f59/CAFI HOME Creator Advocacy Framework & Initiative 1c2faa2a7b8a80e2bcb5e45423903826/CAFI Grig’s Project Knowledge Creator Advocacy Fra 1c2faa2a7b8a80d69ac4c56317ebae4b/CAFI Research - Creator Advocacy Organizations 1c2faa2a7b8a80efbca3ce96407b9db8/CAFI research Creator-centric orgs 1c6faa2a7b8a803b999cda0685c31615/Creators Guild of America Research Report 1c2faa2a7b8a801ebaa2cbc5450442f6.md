## Notes

The Creators Guild of America represents an important development in the professionalization of the creator economy. While previous attempts to organize creators have struggled (like the Internet Creators Guild which shut down in 2019), CGA seems to have learned from these experiences by focusing on tangible benefits like accreditation and professional recognition. Their approach differs from traditional unions by positioning as a professional service organization rather than engaging in collective bargaining.

The CGA's accreditation service, launched in March 2024, appears to be their flagship offering and differentiating factor. Using a platform called Mosaic, they provide creator credits that function similarly to IMDb for film professionals, establishing an independent record of work that isn't tied to specific platforms.

For Distributed Creatives, the CGA represents both a potential partner and a model for certain aspects of creator organization. Their focus on professional standards and recognition complements DC's emphasis on ownership, fair compensation, and technological solutions. There may be opportunities for collaboration, particularly around establishing industry standards that benefit creators across different platforms and disciplines.
