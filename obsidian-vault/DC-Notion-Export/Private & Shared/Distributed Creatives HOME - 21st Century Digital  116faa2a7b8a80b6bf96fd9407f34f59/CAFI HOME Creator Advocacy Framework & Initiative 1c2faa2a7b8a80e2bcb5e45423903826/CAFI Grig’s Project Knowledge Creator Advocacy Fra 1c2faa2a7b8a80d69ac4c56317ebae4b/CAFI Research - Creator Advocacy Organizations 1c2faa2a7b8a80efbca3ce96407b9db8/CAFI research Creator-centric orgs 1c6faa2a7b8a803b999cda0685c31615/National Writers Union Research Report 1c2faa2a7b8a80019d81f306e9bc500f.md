## Notes

The National Writers Union represents an interesting case study in creator advocacy, having evolved from a traditional labor union model to address the unique challenges of freelance writers. Their most significant victories have been in the legal realm, particularly the 2001 Supreme Court case Tasini v. Times, which established important precedents for digital rights.

The organization appears to be in transition following its 2020 disaffiliation from the UAW, which may present both challenges and opportunities for its future direction. The launch of the Freelance Solidarity Project in 2019 demonstrates an effort to adapt to changing media landscapes and the specific needs of digital media workers.

For Distributed Creatives, NWU offers valuable lessons in balancing individual services with collective advocacy while highlighting the importance of demonstrable victories (legal, contractual, or policy) to establish credibility
