## Notes

M-AAA represents a traditional regional arts organization model focused on institutional partnerships rather than individual memberships. While this differs from Distributed Creatives' planned approach, there are valuable lessons in how M-AAA balances direct services with advocacy and leverages collective power. The organization demonstrates the importance of clear value propositions, diverse funding sources, and technological integration - all relevant to Distributed Creatives' development.

A key difference is that M-AAA primarily serves as an intermediary between national funders and local arts organizations, while Distributed Creatives plans to directly engage individual creators. This presents both challenges (more direct constituent management) and opportunities (direct connection to creator needs and concerns).
