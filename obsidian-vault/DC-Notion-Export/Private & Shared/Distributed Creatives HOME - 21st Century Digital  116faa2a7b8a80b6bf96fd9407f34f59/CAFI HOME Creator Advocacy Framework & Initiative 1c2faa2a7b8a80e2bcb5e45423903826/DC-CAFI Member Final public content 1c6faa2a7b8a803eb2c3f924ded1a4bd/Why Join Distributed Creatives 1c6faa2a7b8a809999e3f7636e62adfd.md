# Why Join Distributed Creatives?

# Why Join Distributed Creatives?

As a creator in today's digital landscape, you face unprecedented challenges—from AI systems using your work without permission to complex value chains that direct profits away from those who create. You need more than just another organization asking for membership dues—you need tangible solutions, effective advocacy, and a community that understands your specific challenges.

## Distributed Creatives Offers:

### 1. Practical Tools for Real Problems

Unlike many advocacy organizations that focus primarily on policy, Distributed Creatives provides technological solutions you can use today:

- **Provenance tracking systems** that document the origin and ownership of your creative works
- **Licensing frameworks** that give you control over how your work is used, including for AI training
- **Distributed storage solutions** that preserve your creative legacy beyond the lifespan of any single platform

### 2. Cross-Disciplinary Community

Most creator organizations serve narrow disciplines—ASCAP for music, Authors Guild for writers, American Society of Media Photographers for photographers. Distributed Creatives brings together creators across all disciplines, recognizing that:

- Many creators work across multiple mediums and need support that crosses these boundaries
- The most effective advocacy comes from united voices across the creative spectrum
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration opens new opportunities for innovation and growth

### 3. Balanced Support for All Career Stages

Whether you're just starting out or already established, Distributed Creatives meets you where you are:

- **Free basic membership** ensures everyone can participate, unlike organizations with high membership fees
- **Emerging creator resources** help you develop professional practices from day one
- **Established creator tools** help you leverage your existing work for sustained income
- **Knowledge sharing across career stages** benefits everyone in the community

### 4. Both Individual Benefits and Collective Power

We combine immediate practical support with long-term systemic change:

- **Individual tools and resources** help you protect and monetize your work today
- **Collective advocacy** addresses structural issues that no creator can solve alone
- **Local community connections** provide in-person support and collaboration
- **Global advocacy impact** ensures your voice is heard in policy discussions worldwide

### 5. The Organization We Wish Already Existed

As creators ourselves, we built Distributed Creatives to fill the gaps left by existing organizations. We're not competing with discipline-specific groups—we're creating infrastructure that strengthens the entire creative ecosystem.
