2 my honest opinion feels like 1 as all we have to do is keep doing the work and I believe it’s inevitable. The only thing that will stop me from doing this work is if I were to die. I ride with spirit on that one and it’s what brought me here so don’t expect it cut the ride any time soon. I’m like Crazy Horse riding into battle as long as I don’t fall into fear I’ll be protected.

# **(Priorities: Out of all of the projects goals and objectives related to those goals, how would you prioritize the need for action on each?)**

While all goals are high priority, here’s how they are prioritized in terms of valuation and impact, from highest to lowest, alongside the rationale for their ranking:

### **1. Funding**

**Highest Priority**

- **Why**: Securing funding is the foundation for all other objectives. Without financial resources, platform development, LAN installation, and onboarding processes cannot move forward effectively.
- **Actions**:
    - Complete grant documents and applications.
    - Develop the pitch deck for donor outreach.
    - Launch the eARTh pARTy Conference to raise funds.

---

### **2. Platform Development**

**High Priority**

- **Why**: A fully functional and user-friendly platform is essential to attract and retain users, enabling the success of LAN, closed beta, and open beta.
- **Actions**:
    - Finalize development of LAN and Musely platforms.
    - Ensure all onboarding processes are developed and tested before user onboarding begins.

---

### **3. LAN Installation**

**High Priority**

- **Why**: LAN installations in Boulder serve as a proof of concept and a cornerstone for the closed beta, connecting local artists and venues.
- **Actions**:
    - Install LAN in the two confirmed venues.
    - Continue discussions with Illegal Pete’s corporate staff to secure the third venue.

---

### **4. Closed Beta**

**Medium-High Priority**

- **Why**: The closed beta will refine the platform’s user experience and build credibility by involving respected local creators.
- **Actions**:
    - Onboard a select group of creators into the beta.
    - Develop a comprehensive onboarding process to ensure seamless integration and engagement.

---

### **5. Open Beta**

**Medium Priority**

- **Why**: The open beta will expand the user base and increase platform visibility, but it depends on the success of prior steps (funding, platform readiness, and closed beta).
- **Actions**:
    - Use insights from the closed beta to optimize the platform.
    - Launch with a large, high-profile event to maximize impact.

---

### **Key Considerations**

- **Process Development**: All onboarding processes must be fully developed and tested before the actual user onboarding begins. This ensures a smooth experience for both creators and venues.
- **Simultaneous Networking**: Networking and relationship-building efforts should continue across all phases to maintain momentum and secure future opportunities.

---

**Summary of Priority Order**:

1. **Funding**
2. **Platform Development**
3. **LAN Installation**
4. **Closed Beta**
5. **Open Beta**

By focusing on funding and platform readiness first, Distributed Creatives ensures a strong foundation for the subsequent phases of LAN installations, beta launches, and broader community engagement.
