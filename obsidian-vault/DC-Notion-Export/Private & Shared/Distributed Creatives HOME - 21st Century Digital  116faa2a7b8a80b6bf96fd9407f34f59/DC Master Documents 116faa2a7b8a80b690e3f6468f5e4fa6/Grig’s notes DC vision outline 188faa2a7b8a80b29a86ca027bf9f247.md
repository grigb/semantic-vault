Nonprofit benefits

- corporations rule the world, and become the dominating force, and how they must always consume and earn more for their shareholders which has created a world of diminishing returns for the creators. This ongoing dissolving of human potential can only be reversed through a new approach to the world. A nonprofit organization can provide all the same services and give 100% of the profit back to the world.
