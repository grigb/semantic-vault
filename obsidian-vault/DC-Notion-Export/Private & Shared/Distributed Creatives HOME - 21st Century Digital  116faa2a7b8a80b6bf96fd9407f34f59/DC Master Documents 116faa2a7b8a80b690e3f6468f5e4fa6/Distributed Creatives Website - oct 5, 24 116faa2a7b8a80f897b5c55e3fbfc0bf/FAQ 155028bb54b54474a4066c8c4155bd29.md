Why will we succeed?

We're going to make our art platform stick vs other projects of a similar vein is where building the audience and community from the bottom up. A key project in it is the LAN (local artists network) that is a digital overlay of existing real world art economies and we provide the tools for artists, art enthusiasts and art related businesses to network and participate in an abundant local art economy. We do our beta in Boulder and dial in the model. From there we expand to Colorado and in time the world. As a non-profit the money made through operations goes majority to sponsorships, grants and support for the local nodes. We foster an environment to develop talent organically and then provide the tools for building and running a career all for free to the artist.
