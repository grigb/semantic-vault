# Non-profit vs For profit initial investment value perspective

“Long form”

Matty Bovard, Distributed Creatives co-founder, has dedicated 14 years to developing a platform for the 21st-century art economy. Originally conceived as a for-profit venture, the project sought $400,000 in VC investment but faced challenges due to its novel approach and market unfamiliarity. Transitioning to a non-profit model, the project now aims to raise $200,000 from high-net-worth individuals—a more feasible goal given that $50,000 to $100,000 is a manageable contribution for this demographic.

By developing the digital infrastructure as a public good, the project avoids the constraints and profit-driven motives of VC funding. It focuses instead on serving the needs of artists, art businesses, and enthusiasts, providing media-rich profiles, direct sales, community hosting, and more. With a lower funding target and a mission-driven approach, the non-profit path offers a clearer, more accessible route to launch the Minimum Viable Product (MVP), ensuring a sustainable, decentralized art economy that benefits all stakeholders.

“Mid form”

A platform for the 21st-century art economy, initially a for-profit venture seeking $400,000 in VC funding, struggled due to its innovative nature. Now pivoting to a non-profit model, the project aims to raise $200,000 from high-net-worth individuals, a more achievable goal given their capacity for smaller contributions. Developing this digital infrastructure as a public good allows for a mission-driven approach, fostering a sustainable and decentralized art ecosystem that prioritizes community over profit.

Most distilled

Raising 200K from high net-worth individuals for a non-profit is easier then raising 400k from VC funding to develop infrastructure for 21st century art economy.
