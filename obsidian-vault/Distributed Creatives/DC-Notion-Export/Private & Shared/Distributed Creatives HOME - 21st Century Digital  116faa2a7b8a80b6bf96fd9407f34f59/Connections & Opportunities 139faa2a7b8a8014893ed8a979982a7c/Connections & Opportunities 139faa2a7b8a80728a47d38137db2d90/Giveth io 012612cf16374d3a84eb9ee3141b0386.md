**Giveth is launching a Gurves in early 2025.** They're bonding curves collateralized by GIV that projects on Giveth can launch to evolve into DAOs with their own micro-economies. Gurves enable donors to invest GIV into their favorite projects and provide upside potential for entrepreneurs in the public goods space. Donors become investors, volunteers become shareholders with a voice, and Giveth becomes the Schelling point for impact investments. I'm working on getting in touch with the team about discussing if DC would work for this and more through details on how it works. This would be how we as a non-profit offer a token that can be sold to community like Boulder Block Chain. 

**Notes**

- **Mission and Target Audience**: Focuses on regenerative projects, social good, and community empowerment, ideal for grassroots efforts.
- **Platform Infrastructure**: Decentralized, uses Ethereum blockchain, appeals to Web3-savvy users and transparency-focused donors.
- **Fees**: Minimal, blockchain transaction fees only; Giveth takes no additional percentage.
- **Supported Cryptocurrencies**: Primarily Ethereum and ERC-20 tokens, limited for donors on other blockchains.
- **Fundraising Tools**: Offers milestone-based project tracking but fewer traditional tools.
- **Visibility and Community Engagement**: Strong within Ethereum and regenerative finance communities.
- **Compliance**: Operates without extensive oversight; ideal for decentralized, Web3-comfortable donors.
