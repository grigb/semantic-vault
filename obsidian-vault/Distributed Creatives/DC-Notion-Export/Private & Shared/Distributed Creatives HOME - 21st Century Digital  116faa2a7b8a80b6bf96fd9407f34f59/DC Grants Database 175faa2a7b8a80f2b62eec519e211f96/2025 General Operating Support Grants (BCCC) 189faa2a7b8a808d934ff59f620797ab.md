    DESCRIPTION:
     To bolster the sustainability of the community’s cultural 
    organizations, a series of operating grants is a priority for the 
    cultural grants program. This system of institutional funding supports 
    the Community Priorities and goals in the 2015 [Community Cultural Plan](https://bouldercolorado.gov/community-cultural-plan#:~:text=Together,%20we%20will%20craft%20Boulder%E2%80%99s), including the “Support for Cultural Organizations” strategy.
    
    PURPOSE:
    
    Our approach to operating funding is derived from the [National Assembly of State Arts Agencies](http://www.nasaa-arts.org/), and is here modified to suit the circumstances of the Community Cultural Plan:
    
    - Operating grants maintain the autonomy of grantees, allowing them to allocate the dollars to their most pressing needs.
    - Operating grants tend to be more predictable over time, which helps organizations maintain continuity of services to their communities.
    - Because
    Operating grants are flexible, grantees can use the funds in more
    opportunistic or entrepreneurial ways than project-restricted funds
    often allow.
    - Operating grants come with stringent accountability and management requirements that incentivize and perpetuate good
    business practices among arts organizations.
    - Because the
    grantee—not the grant maker—ultimately defines the activities for which
    Operating grants are used, this funding mechanism can reduce "mission
    drift" among grantees and can help to curtail the proliferation of
    programs designed solely to appeal to funders.
    - Operating grants
    strengthen the non-profit arts infrastructure and deepen working
    relationships between funders and core grantees.
    
    Total Funds Available to New Applicants: $297,000.
    
    Awards: In 2025 there will be four levels of GOS grants, based on the size of the organization’s budget:
    
    - Extra Large Orgs (1M or more) with grants of $55K each
    - Large Orgs (250k - 999k) with grants of $22K each
    - Mid-sized Orgs (100k - 249k) with grants of $11K each
    - Small Orgs (99k or less) with grants of $8.8K each.

    DETAILS
    
    - Your annual revenue according to your 2024 income statement and balance sheet will determine your award category.
    - Once an applicant is approved to receive an Operating Grant, the approval would be valid for the full three-year cycle.
    - Reporting once a year, the organizations will be responsible for providing the
    Boulder Arts Commission with necessary information to track progress on
    their stated evaluation.
    - Due to the rules of the City of
    Boulder’s budget process, the commitment is made for only one year at a
    time. At the end of each year the Boulder Arts Commission will
    re-certify that the grant continues into the next year by approving the
    report. At that time, the Boulder Arts Commission may also choose to
    review specific organizations that may have defaulted on the terms of
    their award in order to advise staff to take action.
    - At each
    November meeting of the Boulder Arts Commission, when the city budget is identified, staff will build recommendations on allocations for the
    following year. This may include increases or decreases to the award
    allocations for grant recipients in proportion to the overall change of
    the budget of the Office of Arts Culture.
