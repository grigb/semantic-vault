# 24 HR DP Brand Launch

**Dank PHART The Pirate Poet: 24-Hour Live Brand Launch Event**

**An Interactive Event to Elevate Art, Creativity, and Blockchain**

In early March, following EthDenver, Dank PHART The Pirate Poet will host a 24-hour live broadcast to launch the next phase of his career. This event will stream simultaneously across all major social media platforms, showcasing live poetry, music, interviews, and conversations about art and philosophy. The broadcast will feature collaborators and characters from Dank PHART’s 15-year journey in the Front Range’s underground art scene.

**Key Launch Elements**

1. **Art Token Introduction**
    - A blockchain-based token designed to empower art brand and provide a tool to develop an ecosystem around the brand.
    - A portion of all NFT sales (thinking 7%) goes into liquidity for the token. My thought process is that it’s investing into value of the brand and the community behind it.
2. **Post-It Note NFT Project**
    - The first Post-It Note poem will be written live during the broadcast. The project is asking:*"Can I make a million dollars in one year with only pen, paper, and creativity?"*
    - The poem will be minted as an NFT and available for purchase as the broadcast ends, setting the stage for an interactive and scalable art project.
    - As the sales happen on this NFT that 7% portion will be directly put into the liquidity pool of the token showcasing the bag pump effect. This inspires the sale of my other work and we’re off to the races.

**Event Goals**

- **Minimum Goals:**
    - 2,000 viewers over 24 hours.
    - 333 NFT sales and strong initial token adoption.
- **High-End Goals:**
    - 30,000 viewers.
    - 13,000 NFT sales and significant engagement with the token.

**Marketing Strategy**

1. **EthDenver Promotion:**
    - Distribute flyers featuring a poem on one side and broadcast details on the other, including a QR code linking directly to the event page.
    - Engage attendees with personal invites and a clear value proposition for joining the event.
2. **Social Media Campaign:**
    - Launch the campaign by January 1st, using consistent content across platforms to build awareness.
    - Post countdowns, behind-the-scenes teasers, and explainers about the Art Token and NFT project.
    - Leverage collaborations and guest appearances to drive interest and sharing.

**Why This Matters**

This event is designed to:

- Build a larger, engaged audience invested in Dank PHART’s journey.
- Showcase the intersection of art and blockchain in a practical, relatable way.
- Kickstart a scalable model for independent artists to monetize creativity while connecting deeply with their audience.

With a clear plan, a strong network, and a unique approach, this 24-hour broadcast will solidify Dank PHART’s brand and set the foundation for long-term success in the evolving art economy.
