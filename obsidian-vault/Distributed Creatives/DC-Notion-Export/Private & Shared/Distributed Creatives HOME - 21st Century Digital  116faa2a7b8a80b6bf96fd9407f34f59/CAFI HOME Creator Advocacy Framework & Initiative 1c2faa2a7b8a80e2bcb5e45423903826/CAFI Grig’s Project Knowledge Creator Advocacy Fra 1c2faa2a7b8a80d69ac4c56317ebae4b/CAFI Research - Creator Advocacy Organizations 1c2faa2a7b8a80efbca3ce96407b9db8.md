        # AI RESEARCH GUIDANCE FOR CREATOR ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS
        
        ## Research Context and Purpose
        
        You are conducting comprehensive research on creator advocacy organizations to inform the development of Distributed Creatives, a new organization focused on supporting creators in maintaining ownership of their work, receiving fair compensation, and connecting directly with their audiences through distributed technology solutions, legal protection, and collective advocacy.
        
        Distributed Creatives aims to build an organization that can effectively:
        
        1. Provide tangible value to individual creators through services and resources
        2. Build collective power through a large membership base (aiming for 100,000+ members)
        3. Effectively advocate for creator rights in the digital landscape
        4. Develop technological solutions for provenance tracking and fair compensation
        5. Create a sustainable business model that serves creators across disciplines
        
        ## Research Approach
        
        Your research should focus on identifying the most effective models, strategies, and practices across existing organizations that could be adapted or improved upon for Distributed Creatives. Pay particular attention to:
        
        1. **Membership Structures**: How organizations design their membership tiers, benefits, and pricing to attract and retain members while providing meaningful value. The AAA model is particularly relevant as it's built a massive membership through everyday benefits while leveraging that scale for significant advocacy power.
        2. **Value Propositions**: The specific benefits, services, and resources that organizations offer to make membership compelling to creators, especially those that address immediate needs while supporting longer-term goals.
        3. **Advocacy Effectiveness**: How organizations translate membership into advocacy power, particularly regarding copyright, fair compensation, and digital rights in ways that achieve tangible results.
        4. **Digital Presence and Technology**: Innovative technological approaches, platforms, and tools that organizations have developed to support their missions and serve members efficiently.
        5. **Growth Strategies**: Methods for building membership, especially approaches that have achieved significant scale or rapid growth through referrals, partnerships, or other mechanisms.
        6. **Communication Approaches**: Effective messaging strategies that communicate complex issues clearly and compellingly to both members and external stakeholders.
        7. **Sustainability Models**: How organizations maintain financial sustainability while serving their mission, including revenue diversification beyond membership dues.
        
        ## Research Differentiation
        
        When reviewing organizations, pay special attention to what makes Distributed Creatives potentially unique:
        
        1. **Cross-disciplinary approach**: Unlike many existing organizations that focus on specific creative disciplines (music, writing, photography), Distributed Creatives aims to serve creators across all disciplines.
        2. **Technology focus**: Distributed Creatives plans to integrate advocacy with practical technological solutions (distributed storage, provenance tracking, licensing frameworks).
        3. **Community-based approach**: The organization intends to connect with real-world communities rather than just digital outreach.
        4. **Long-term preservation**: Few organizations specifically address the preservation of creative works for future generations as a core value.
        5. **Balance between individual and collective**: The framework seeks to balance individual creator sovereignty with collective power.
        6. **Accessibility focus**: Distributed Creatives aims to democratize access to creative works while ensuring fair compensation.
        7. **Seven core values**: Creator Sovereignty, Fair Compensation, Technological Empowerment, Transparency, Collective Power, Accessibility, and Long-term Preservation form the foundation of the organization's principles.
        
        ## Research Output Expectations
        
        For each organization, complete all sections of the template thoroughly, providing:
        
        1. **Concrete examples** rather than general descriptions
        2. **Specific metrics** whenever available (membership numbers, pricing, growth rates)
        3. **Direct quotes** from the organization's materials that illuminate their positioning or approach
        4. **Visual descriptions** of their digital properties, branding, and user experience
        5. **Comparative insights** noting how their approach compares to other organizations
        6. **Actionable takeaways** for how Distributed Creatives might adapt or improve upon their models
        
        The goal is to produce a comprehensive analysis that serves as a foundation for strategic decision-making in the development of Distributed Creatives' membership structure, value proposition, advocacy approach, and operational model.
        
        ## Priority Organizations
        
        While all 50 organizations on the list provide valuable insights, consider prioritizing research on:
        
        1. Organizations with large membership bases that demonstrate successful scaling (like AAA)
        2. Those with innovative technological approaches to creator issues
        3. Organizations that have achieved significant advocacy wins
        4. Those with particularly effective membership value propositions
        5. Organizations serving multiple creative disciplines
        6. Those with business models that effectively balance immediate member benefits with long-term advocacy
        
        # CREATOR ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION RESEARCH TEMPLATE
        
        ## Purpose
        
        This template provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing creator advocacy organizations, professional associations, and membership-based groups. It is designed to extract detailed information about organizational structure, membership models, advocacy approaches, and operational strategies to inform the development of Distributed Creatives.
        
        ## Research Instructions
        
        To effectively use this template:
        
        1. **Conduct multi-source research**: Examine the organization's website, social media presence, press releases, third-party articles, annual reports, and public filings (Form 990 for nonprofits).
        2. **Follow a systematic approach**: Complete each section in order, using the provided questions as guides.
        3. **Be specific and data-driven**: Include concrete examples, statistics, and direct evidence rather than general impressions.
        4. **Note uncertainty**: If information is not publicly available, indicate this rather than speculating.
        5. **Identify patterns**: Pay special attention to unique or innovative approaches that distinguish the organization.
        6. **Document sources**: Track where each piece of information was found for future reference.
        7. **Focus on application**: Consider how each element could be adapted for Distributed Creatives.
        8. **Compare consistently**: Use similar language and frameworks across organizations to facilitate comparison.
