## Notes

The IFJ represents an interesting hybrid model combining trade union principles with press freedom advocacy. This dual focus allows it to address both immediate working conditions and broader systemic issues affecting journalism. Its regional structure enables cultural adaptability while maintaining global principles - an approach Distributed Creatives could learn from.

The organization's longevity (nearly 100 years with some interruptions) demonstrates the value of having clear principles and tangible member benefits. The International Press Card is particularly notable as a concrete, valuable credential that helps identify and protect working journalists.

While IFJ has adapted to include digital media workers, it appears less focused on technological solutions and more on traditional advocacy and protection mechanisms. This creates an opportunity for Distributed Cre
