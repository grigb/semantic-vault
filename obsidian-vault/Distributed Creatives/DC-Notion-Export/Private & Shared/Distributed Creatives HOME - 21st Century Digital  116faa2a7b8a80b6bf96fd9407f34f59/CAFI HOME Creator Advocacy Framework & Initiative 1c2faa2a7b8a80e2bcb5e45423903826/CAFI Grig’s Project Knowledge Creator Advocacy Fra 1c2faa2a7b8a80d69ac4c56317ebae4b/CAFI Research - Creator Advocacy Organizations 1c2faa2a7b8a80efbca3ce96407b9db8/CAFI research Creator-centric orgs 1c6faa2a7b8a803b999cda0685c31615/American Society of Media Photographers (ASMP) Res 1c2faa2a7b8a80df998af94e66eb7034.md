## Notes

ASMP represents an established, respected model of a creator advocacy organization with nearly 80 years of history. Its evolution from focusing solely on photographers for publication to encompassing a wider range of visual content creators demonstrates both adaptability and the challenge of maintaining relevance in a rapidly changing digital landscape. The organization's strength in legal advocacy and copyright education could be valuable to learn from, while its traditional structure may present opportunities for Distributed Creatives to innovate beyond this model with more transparent governance and technological integration.

The recent leadership under James Edmund Datri has pushed digital transformation and membership expansion, resulting in significant growth. This suggests that creator advocacy organizations can successfully evolve their membership criteria and value propositions to embrace new forms of creative work while maintaining their core mission and values.
