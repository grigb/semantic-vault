## Notes

The Digital Media & Learning Initiative represents one of the most significant philanthropic investments in understanding how technology is changing learning. While it was primarily focused on youth education rather than creator advocacy, many of its principles around interest-driven learning, connecting learning environments, and creating alternative credentials have direct application to Distributed Creatives' mission.

The initiative's evolution from research to implementation to spinning off independent organizations provides a useful model for how a well-resourced initiative can seed long-term change. The Connected Learning Lab at UC Irvine continues the legacy of this work and could be a potential research partner for Distributed Creatives.

The initiative's focus on building networks rather than operating as a traditional membership organization makes it different from some of Distributed Creatives' comparative models, but the emphasis on connecting diverse stakeholders around shared principles is highly relevant.
