## Notes

The Center for Art & Advocacy represents a unique model in the creator advocacy space, focusing specifically on formerly incarcerated artists through a multifaceted approach that includes funding, education, and physical space. The organization's artist-led structure and alignment with major arts funders gives it significant potential for impact despite its relative newness.

The Center's evolution from the Right of Return Fellowship demonstrates how a targeted program can grow into a more comprehensive organization when it identifies and addresses specific needs in its community. This growth model could be instructive for Distributed Creatives, particularly in developing programs that can later expand into broader initiatives.

The organization's heavy reliance on major foundation support presents both an advantage (substantial resources) and a potential challenge (sustainability if funding priorities shift). Distributed Creatives may want to consider more diversified funding approaches while still pursuing major institutional support.

The three-program structure (Fellowship, Academy, Residency) provides a useful model for addressing different needs within a creator community, from direct financial support to education to physical space and community building. This holistic approach aligns well with
