## Notes

The Open Rights Group provides an excellent model of a focused, mission-driven digital rights organization that has successfully grown from a grassroots pledge campaign to the UK's largest digital rights advocacy group. Their emphasis on local groups creates geographic reach despite limited resources, and their clear positioning in the digital rights space gives them credibility and focus.

Distributed Creatives can learn from ORG's successful community-building approach while developing its unique focus on creator sovereignty and technological solutions alongside advocacy. The organizations have complementary missions that could lead to future collaboration, particularly around issues of AI training data, algorithmic transparency, and creator compensation in digital spaces.
