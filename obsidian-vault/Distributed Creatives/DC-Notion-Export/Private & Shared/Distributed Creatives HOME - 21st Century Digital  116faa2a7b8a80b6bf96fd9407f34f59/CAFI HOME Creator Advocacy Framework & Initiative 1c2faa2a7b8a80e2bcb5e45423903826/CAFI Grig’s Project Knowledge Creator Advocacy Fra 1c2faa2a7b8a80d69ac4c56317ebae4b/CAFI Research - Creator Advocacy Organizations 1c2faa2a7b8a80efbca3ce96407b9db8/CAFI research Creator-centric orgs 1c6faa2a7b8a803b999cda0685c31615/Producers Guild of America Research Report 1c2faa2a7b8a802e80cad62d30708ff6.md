## Notes

The PGA demonstrates the power of focused professional standards in building industry influence. Their successful implementation of the Producers Mark (p.g.a.) shows how a visual certification can establish authority and recognition. Their council-based governance ensures representation across different production categories - a model Distributed Creatives could adapt for cross-disciplinary creative fields.

The PGA's membership qualification process is significantly more stringent than what DC envisions, which limits their size but enhances their authority. DC's more inclusive approach will require different advocacy strategies but could build a much larger coalition. The PGA's balance of professional benefits with industry advocacy provides a useful model for sustaining member engagement beyond ideological support.

The PGA has effectively navigated technological transitions from film to television to digital, maintaining relevance by adapting their standards and resources. However, they have not embraced technological solutions to the degree that DC envisions, creating a clear differentiation opportunity around distributed technology for creator protection.
