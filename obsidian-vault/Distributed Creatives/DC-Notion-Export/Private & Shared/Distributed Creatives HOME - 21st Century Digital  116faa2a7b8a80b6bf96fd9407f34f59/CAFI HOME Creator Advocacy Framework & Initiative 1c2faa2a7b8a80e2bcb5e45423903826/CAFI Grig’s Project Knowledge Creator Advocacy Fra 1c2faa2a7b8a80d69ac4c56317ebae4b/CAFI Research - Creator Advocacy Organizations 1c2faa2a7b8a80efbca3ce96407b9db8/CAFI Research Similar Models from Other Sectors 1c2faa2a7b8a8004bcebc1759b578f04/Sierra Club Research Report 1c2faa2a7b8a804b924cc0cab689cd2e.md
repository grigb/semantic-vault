## Notes

The Sierra Club provides an excellent model for CAFI, particularly in how it balances immediate member benefits with long-term advocacy goals. While the subject matter differs greatly (environmental protection vs. creator rights), the fundamental challenge is similar: building a large, engaged membership base that derives value from participation while creating collective power for systemic change.

The Sierra Club's chapter model is particularly relevant as CAFI considers how to organize across creator disciplines. While CAFI might not use geographic chapters, discipline-based "chapters" (writers, musicians, visual artists, etc.) could provide similar community benefits while maintaining a unified organizational structure.

Sierra Club's pricing strategy‚Äîwith an intentionally low barrier to entry ($15) but suggested higher amounts‚Äîcould be directly applicable to CAFI's membership model. Similarly, their diverse revenue streams beyond membership dues provide a sustainable financial model worth emulating.

The organization's evolution over time, particularly their expansion from conservation to broader environmental and social justice issues, offers lessons for how CAFI might evolve beyond initial focus areas. Their increasing emphasis on environmental justice parallels CAFI's potential to connect creator rights with broader issues of economic justice and labor rights.

Sierra Club's balance of recreational activities (outings) with advocacy creates a unique value proposition; CAFI might similarly balance practical creator resources and community with advocacy work. This "service to members plus collective advocacy" model has proven remarkably durable for Sierra Club and could be similarly effective for creator advocacy.

The Sierra Club's ability to mobilize its massive membership for specific advocacy campaigns, while also maintaining ongoing programs, demonstrates how CAFI might balance immediate threats (e.g., AI training on creator works without compensation) with longer-term systemic changes in how creative work is valued and protected.
