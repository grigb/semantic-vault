## Notes

The AAA presents a particularly relevant model for Distributed Creatives due to its dual nature as both a service provider and an advocacy organization. While its federation structure may not be directly applicable, its approach to building massive membership through immediate tangible benefits while leveraging that scale for advocacy power provides a proven template.

The key insight from AAA's success is that members join and renew primarily for immediate benefits (roadside assistance), but the organization leverages that membership base for significant policy influence. This "trojan horse" approach to advocacy—where the immediate value proposition attracts members, and the advocacy happens as a secondary benefit—could be particularly effective for creator advocacy.

For Distributed Creatives, this suggests focusing first on solving immediate creator problems (legal protection, contract review, licensing frameworks) as the primary value proposition, while using the resulting membership base to drive larger systemic change. The "emergency roadside assistance" equivalent for creators might be copyright infringement support, AI training opt-out tools, or contract review services.

AAA has also demonstrated remarkable staying power through technological changes by adapting its core services while maintaining its fundamental value proposition. As creator needs evolve with technology, Distributed Creatives could similarly adapt specific services while maintaining its core mission of creator sovereignty and fair compensation.

The AAA model suggests that a membership target of 100,000+ is ambitious but achievable if the immediate value proposition is sufficiently compelling. Each member who receives tangible help becomes an advocate for the organization, creating a virtuous cycle of growth through demonstrated value.
