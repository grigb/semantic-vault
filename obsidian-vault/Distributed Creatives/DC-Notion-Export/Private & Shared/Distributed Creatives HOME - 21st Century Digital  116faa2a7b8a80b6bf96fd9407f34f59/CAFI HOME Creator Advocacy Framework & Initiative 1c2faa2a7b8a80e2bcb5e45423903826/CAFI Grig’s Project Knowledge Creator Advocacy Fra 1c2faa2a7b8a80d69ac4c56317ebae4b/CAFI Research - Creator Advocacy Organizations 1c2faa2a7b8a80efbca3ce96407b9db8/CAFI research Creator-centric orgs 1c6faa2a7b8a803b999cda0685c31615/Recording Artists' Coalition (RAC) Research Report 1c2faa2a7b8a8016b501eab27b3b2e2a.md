## Notes

The Recording Artists' Coalition represents an important case study in creator advocacy with both successes and limitations. Founded by high-profile artists Don Henley and Sheryl Crow in 2000, the RAC achieved significant policy victories, particularly in preventing copyright law changes that would have disadvantaged artists. Their ability to leverage celebrity status for policy influence demonstrates the power of high-profile creator involvement.

However, the RAC's eventual merger into the Recording Academy suggests potential sustainability challenges for independent creator advocacy organizations. Additionally, criticisms that the RAC primarily served the interests of already-successful artists highlight the importance of inclusive membership models that serve creators at all career stages.

For Distributed Creatives, the RAC offers valuable lessons in effective advocacy, powerful fundraising approaches, and the importance of clear, focused messaging. DC can build upon these strengths while addressing the RAC's limitations through broader inclusivity, sustainable operational models, and balanced technological and advocacy approaches that serve the entire creator ecosystem rather than only established professionals.
