## Notes

The Free Software Foundation represents a particularly relevant model for Distributed Creatives, given its successful balancing of individual creator rights with collective advocacy. FSF's approach to licensing through the GPL, which uses copyright law to ensure user freedoms, provides a powerful example of how legal tools can be leveraged to protect creators while promoting sharing and collaboration.

FSF's membership structure, with its combination of individual benefits and collective impact, mirrors the approach Distributed Creatives is considering. The recent addition of more affordable membership tiers to increase accessibility and diversity is especially relevant to building an inclusive creator community.

Unlike many organizations focusing on a single creative discipline, FSF has successfully built a movement around a set of principles (the four freedoms) that transcend specific technologies or applications. This principled yet practical approach could inform Distributed Creatives' cross-disciplinary strategy.

The collaboration between FSF and Creative Commons on license compatibility demonstrates how organizations with aligned values can work together effectively, even when their specific implementations differ. This model of cooperation among aligned but distinct organizations could inform Distributed Creatives' partnership strategy.
