## Notes

The Electronic Frontier Alliance demonstrates the effectiveness of a principles-based, low-barrier membership model that connects grassroots organizations while preserving their autonomy. Its integration with EFF provides substantial resources and legitimacy that would be difficult for a new network to establish independently. For Distributed Creatives, the EFA offers a valuable model for how to build a principled network that balances centralized resources with decentralized action, though Distributed Creatives' focus on technological solutions and creator-specific issues presents opportunities for differentiation. The challenge will be providing sufficient value to members while building the infrastructure and resources needed for effective advocacy.
