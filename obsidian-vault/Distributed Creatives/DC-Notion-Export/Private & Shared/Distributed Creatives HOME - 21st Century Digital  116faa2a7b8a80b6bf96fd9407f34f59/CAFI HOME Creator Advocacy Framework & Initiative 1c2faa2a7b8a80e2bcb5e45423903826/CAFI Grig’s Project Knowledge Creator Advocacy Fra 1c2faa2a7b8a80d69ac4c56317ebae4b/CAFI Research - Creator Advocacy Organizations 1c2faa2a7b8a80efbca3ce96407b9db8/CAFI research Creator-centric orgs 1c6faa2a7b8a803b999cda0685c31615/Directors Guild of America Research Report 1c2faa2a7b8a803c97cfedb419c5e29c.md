## Notes

The Directors Guild of America represents a traditional but effective model of creator advocacy through collective bargaining, legal enforcement, and industry standardization. While its approach differs significantly from Distributed Creatives' cross-disciplinary, technology-focused vision, it demonstrates the power of collective action when membership reaches critical mass and when clear, tangible benefits are provided to members. The DGA's prestigious health and pension benefits particularly stand out as a compelling reason for membership, suggesting that Distributed Creatives' offering should include similarly concrete advantages beyond the more abstract benefits of advocacy.
