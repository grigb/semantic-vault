## Notes

ASCAP represents a highly successful model of creator advocacy and rights management with over a century of operation. Its not-for-profit, member-owned and governed structure aligns closely with the vision for Distributed Creatives, offering valuable lessons in building collective power while serving individual creator needs.

The organization has successfully navigated massive technological and industry changes while maintaining its core mission of protecting creator rights and ensuring fair compensation. Its evolution from protecting rights for sheet music and live performances to addressing streaming, AI, and digital platforms demonstrates the importance of adaptability.

ASCAP's combination of pragmatic services (royalty collection and distribution) with aspirational advocacy creates a compelling value proposition that has attracted over 960,000 members. Similarly, Distributed Creatives should balance immediate creator needs with long-term vision.

The ASCAP Foundation provides a model for how a creator advocacy organization can expand its impact through education, humanitarian work, and community outreach while maintaining focus on its core mission.

Areas where Distributed Creatives can differentiate include cross-disciplinary scope beyond music, focus on distributed technology from inception, emphasis on long-term preservation, and addressing the full spectrum of creator rights beyond what ASCAP can offer under its consent decree limitations.

A key insight from studying ASCAP is the power of democratic governance in establishing legitimacy and trust with creators. The equal representation of writers and publishers on ASCAP's board ensures that diverse perspectives are considered in decision-making, a principle that could be adapted to serve multiple creative disciplines in Distributed Creatives.

Another important lesson is ASCAP's successful transition to digital platforms while maintaining its core mission. As Distributed Creatives develops, it should similarly maintain flexibility to adapt to technological changes without losing focus on creator advocacy.

Finally, ASCAP's recent focus on AI and emerging technologies through the ASCAP Lab offers a template for how Distributed Creatives can engage with technological innovation in a way that prioritizes creator interests. The six AI principles developed by ASCAP could serve as a foundation for Distributed Creatives' approach to AI across all creative disciplines.
