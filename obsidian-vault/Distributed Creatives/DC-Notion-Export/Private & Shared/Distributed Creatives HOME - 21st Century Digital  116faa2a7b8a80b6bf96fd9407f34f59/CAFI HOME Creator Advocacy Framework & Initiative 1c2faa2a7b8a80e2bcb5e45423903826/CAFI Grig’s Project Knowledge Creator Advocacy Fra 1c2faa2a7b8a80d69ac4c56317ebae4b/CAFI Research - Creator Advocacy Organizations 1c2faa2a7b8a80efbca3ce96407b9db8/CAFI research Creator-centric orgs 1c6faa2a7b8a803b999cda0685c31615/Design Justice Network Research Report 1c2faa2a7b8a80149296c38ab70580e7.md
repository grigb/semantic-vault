## Research Sources

- **Primary Website Analysis Date**: March 25, 2025

## Notes

The Design Justice Network offers a valuable model for principles-driven community building that Distributed Creatives could adapt. Their success in creating a clear framework (the 10 principles) that guides action without imposing rigid structures could be particularly relevant. However, CAFI's emphasis on technological solutions and economic justice for creators represents a complementary but distinct focus that could differentiate it in the broader ecosystem of creator advocacy organizations. The chapter-based model could be adapted to create local communities while maintaining the technological infrastructure and advocacy power of a centralized organization.
