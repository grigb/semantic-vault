## Notes

The Arts & Culture Advocacy Program represents an interesting model of a specialized program within a larger advocacy coalition. Its focus on education and direct intervention without litigation aligns well with Distributed Creatives' approach. The program's longevity (20+ years) demonstrates sustainability for this model, though specific information about resourcing is limited.

The most distinctive feature of ACAP is its position as the only national program specifically focused on artistic freedom and censorship issues in the US. This gives it a clear niche and purpose, though it operates on what appears to be a relatively small scale. The annual Curatorial Workshop represents an interesting model for community building and practical education that could be adapted for Distributed Creatives' purposes.

The program's affiliation with NCAC provides it with institutional support from a coalition of over 50 national organizations, giving it greater influence than its size would suggest. This coalition model might be worth considering for Distributed Creatives as it builds partnerships and seeks to amplify its impact.
