## Notes

The Illustrators Partnership of America (IPA) has been a significant force in advocacy for illustrators' rights, particularly regarding copyright protection and fair compensation. Founded by renowned illustrator Brad Holland and others in 1999, it has focused intensely on protecting illustrators from legislation that would weaken their control over their work, such as the Orphan Works Acts.

IPA's most notable achievement was helping to establish the American Society of Illustrators Partnership (ASIP) in 2007, which united 12 illustration organizations to advocate for proper collection and distribution of reprographic royalties to illustrators. This initiative addressed the problem that foreign visual art collecting societies were collecting royalties for American illustrators but had no U.S. organization to distribute these funds to the rightful creators.

The organization appears to operate with minimal overhead and public visibility between major legislative battles, but mobilizes effectively when specific threats arise. Its leadership consists of working illustrators with expertise in copyright issues, lending credibility to its advocacy efforts.

For Distributed Creatives, IPA represents a potential ally in advocacy efforts while also offering lessons in the importance of focused mission, expert credibility, and coalition-building. DC's broader cross-disciplinary approach and technology focus could complement IPA's specialized policy advocacy for illustrators specifically.
