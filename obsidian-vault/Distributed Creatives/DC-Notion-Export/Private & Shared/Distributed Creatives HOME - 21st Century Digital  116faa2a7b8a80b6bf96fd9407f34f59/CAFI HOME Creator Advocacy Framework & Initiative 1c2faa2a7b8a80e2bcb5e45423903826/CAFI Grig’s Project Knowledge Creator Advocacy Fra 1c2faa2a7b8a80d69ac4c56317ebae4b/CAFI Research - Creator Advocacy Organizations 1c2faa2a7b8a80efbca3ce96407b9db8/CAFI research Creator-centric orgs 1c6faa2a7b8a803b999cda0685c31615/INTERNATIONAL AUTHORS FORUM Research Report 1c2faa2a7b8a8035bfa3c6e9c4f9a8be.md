## Notes

The International Authors Forum operates primarily as an umbrella organization for authors' associations rather than serving individual authors directly. This contrasts with Distributed Creatives' vision of building a large individual membership base (100,000+) while still maintaining organizational partnerships. IAF's focus on policy and international representation provides valuable lessons, but DC has an opportunity to differentiate through direct creator benefits, technology solutions, and community building that addresses immediate creator needs while supporting long-term advocacy goals.

IAF appears active in addressing AI issues, but from a traditional copyright and policy perspective rather than developing technological solutions. DC's technological focus and emphasis on preservation represent significant differentiators that could complement IAF's work rather than competing with it.
