## Main Topics

### 2. Challenges in the Creator Economy (Timestamp: 4:30)

- **Overview**: The group explored systemic obstacles creators face in today’s landscape.
- **Key Points**:
    - **Overwhelming Competition**: Too many projects and solutions flood the digital realm, making it hard for creators to stand out or secure funding (Grig, 4:53).
    - **Perception Issue**: People often assume creators just want money, undermining their efforts (Matty, 6:18; Grig, 6:23).
    - **Exhausting Environment**: The “firehose of information” and “endless wasteland” of digital onboarding create a taxing situation (Matty, 3:04; Dr. Brian, 6:36).
- **Sentiments**:
    - Frustration at the noisy, competitive terrain (Grig, 5:52).
    - Agreement that a new approach—connecting real-world communities—is essential (Matty, 3:49).
- **Key Idea**: Flipping the narrative from “what do we need to do?” to “what’s preventing the solution?” could unlock progress (Grig, 4:53).

### 3. Proposal for a Creator Advocacy Organization (Timestamp: 7:29)

- **Overview**: Grig proposed a membership-based organization to address creators’ systemic issues collectively, rather than pushing a single tech solution.
- **Details**:
    - **Goal**: Build a large community (100,000+ members) to lobby for creator rights and interests globally (Grig, 11:09).
    - **Narrative**: Start with a simple story—“we recognize your challenges as a creator”—to resonate widely (Grig, 7:52).
    - **Structure**:
        - Free initial membership to avoid the “asking for money” stigma, with tiered dues later for high earners or companies (Grig, 20:58-22:13).
        - Model after groups like AAA (lobbying power) or OMA3 (consortium synergy) (Grig, 11:47, 17:47).
    - **Focus Areas**: Address AI-driven piracy (e.g., books used for training data without compensation) and other longstanding issues (Grig, 8:50; Dr. Brian, 9:10).
- **Reactions**:
    - Matty strongly supported it, seeing it as a way to strengthen Distributed Creatives’ story (15:08).
    - Dr. Brian agreed, noting its potential to attract support (implicit in his Hollywood focus, 39:26).
- **Key Ideas**:
    - A unified voice amplifies creators’ power against oppression (Grig, 10:55).
    - Technology (e.g., licensing for AI training) can follow advocacy, not lead it (Grig, 18:42).

### 4. Leveraging Connections and Influence (Timestamp: 14:28)

- **Overview**: The group discussed using high-profile creators to boost the organization’s momentum and credibility.
- **Strategies**:
    - **Hollywood Connections**: Tap influential figures like Matty’s brother-in-law (writer/producer on *ER*, *The Pit*) and Dr. Brian’s fraternity brother Coleman Domingo (Grig, 27:12; Dr. Brian, 28:13).
    - **Simple Ask**: Request names and endorsements rather than heavy involvement (Grig, 30:04).
    - **Positioning**: Frame the organization as a solution to AI threats and other creator concerns (Grig, 13:38).
- **Key Points**:
    - Early traction from big names could ease funding and tech development later (Grig, 14:28).
    - Matty’s networking skills and Dr. Brian’s SAG membership are assets (Grig, 27:34; Dr. Brian, 40:10).
- **Impression**: Excitement about opening doors, tempered by the need for a clear pitch (Matty, 39:35).

### 5. Next Steps and Action Items (Timestamp: 25:22)

- **Overview**: The group outlined immediate tasks to advance the advocacy framework.
- **Commitments**:
    - **Grig**: Create a simple, clear landing page over the weekend to articulate the refined direction (56:53).
    - **Matty**: Contact his brother-in-law once the new phase is set (27:56).
    - **Dr. Brian**: Leverage SAG membership and Hollywood connections; explore job search automation tools to free up time (40:10, implied at 25:22).
- **Ideas**:
    - Use AI tools (e.g., RAG method) for outreach and research to target creators efficiently (Grig, 43:45).
    - Build an email list via Google Workspace (nonprofit access granted) for signups (Grig, 32:42).
- **Key Point**: Strengthening the story now drives support later—financial and otherwise (Matty, 25:34).

## Additional Notes

- **Structural Inspiration**:
    - Model after OMA3 (corporate consortium), Metaverse Standards Forum, or Bloom Network for simplicity and scale (Grig, 17:47, 31:38).
    - Consider a for-profit consortium alongside a member-driven advocacy group (Grig, 17:47).
- **Technology Integration**:
    - Plan to use Google Workspace for managing memberships and communications (Grig, 32:42).
    - Explore AI-driven outreach with a unified message (Grig, 43:45).
- **Impressions**:
    - Grig is confident in rapid implementation once the framework is set (56:53).
    - Matty and Dr. Brian are excited, seeing this as a natural evolution of Distributed Creatives (Matty, 34:32; Dr. Brian, implicit in 39:26).
- **Contextual Factors**:
    - Dr. Brian’s personal overwhelm (taxes, health, visitor) may limit his immediate capacity, though he remains dedicated (34:32-36:19).
    - Matty’s job plan supports his involvement without burnout (34:07).

## Conclusion

Immediate next steps—landing page development, outreach via AI and networks—aim to build momentum quickly. Despite personal challenges, the board’s enthusiasm and alignment signal a promising path forward for this initiative.
