The following is an AI summary of the conversation I've had with several people online and with Matty (a Distributed Creatives director). 

# Distributed Creatives - Creator Advocacy Framework

# Vision Statement

We envision a world where creators thrive through fair compensation, ownership of their work, and meaningful connections with their audiences—a creative ecosystem built on transparency, choice, and respect where technology empowers rather than exploits. We see a future where creative professions are sustainable career paths with appropriate protections, where AI and other technologies serve creators rather than replace them, and where the value generated from creative works flows primarily to those who create them.

## Mission Statement

We provide distributed technology solutions, legal protection, and collective advocacy to help creators maintain ownership of their work, receive fair compensation, build sustainable careers, and connect directly with their audiences—all while defending their rights in the rapidly evolving digital landscape. We build the infrastructure, tools, and community needed to fundamentally transform how creative work is valued, protected, and shared in the digital age.

## Core Values

### 1. Creator Sovereignty

We believe creators should maintain control over how their work is used, shared, and monetized. They deserve ownership of both their content and their relationship with their audience. This includes the right to determine whether their work can be used for AI training and to receive appropriate compensation when it is.

### 2. Fair Compensation

We believe the value created by artistic and intellectual works should flow primarily to their creators rather than intermediaries, platforms, or unauthorized AI training systems. No creator should receive $18 royalty checks for their books or work 80+ hour weeks in visual effects while struggling to pay bills. Fair compensation is not just about higher percentages—it's about restructuring the entire value chain of creative industries.

### 3. Technological Empowerment

We believe technology should serve creators, not exploit them. We build systems that enhance creative potential while protecting intellectual property rights. Our distributed storage solutions, provenance tracking, and licensing frameworks are designed to give creators the tools they need to thrive in a digital environment, not just survive.

### 4. Transparency

We believe in clear, understandable terms for how creative works are used, shared, and monetized—ending the era of impenetrable contracts and hidden exploitation. Creators deserve to know exactly how their work is being used and how they're being compensated, in language they can understand without a team of lawyers.

### 5. Collective Power

We believe creators are strongest when united. By organizing collectively, creators can establish industry standards, influence legislation, and ensure technological developments respect their rights. Our membership model provides both individual benefits and collective advocacy power, modeled after successful organizations like the AAA that serve members while shaping policy.

### 6. Accessibility

We believe in democratizing access to creative works and knowledge, while ensuring creators are fairly compensated. Knowledge and creativity should not be gated by unnecessarily high costs or restrictive platforms. Academic research should be available to those who need it without exorbitant fees, and creators should be able to reach audiences without gatekeepers.

### 7. Long-term Preservation

We believe creative works deserve to be preserved for future generations. Unlike current archival solutions that are vulnerable to takedowns or centralized control, our distributed storage ensures permanent access with proper attribution and licensing intact.

## Measuring Success

We will measure our impact through:

1. **Economic Metrics**
    - Average creator income increase
    - Percentage of revenue flowing to creators vs. intermediaries
    - Number of creators able to sustain full-time creative careers
2. **Technical Metrics**
    - Volume of work stored with proper provenance
    - Reduction in unauthorized usage of creative works
    - System reliability and accessibility
3. **Advocacy Metrics**
    - Legislation passed supporting creator rights
    - Adoption of creator-friendly practices by major platforms
    - Public awareness of creator compensation issues
4. **Community Metrics**
    - Membership growth and engagement
    - Creator satisfaction and retention
    - Diversity of creative disciplines represented

## Our Approach

We recognize that both technological solutions and cultural/structural changes are necessary. Our approach combines innovative technology development with a strong community of creators advocating for systemic change.

Like the AAA does for drivers, we aim to provide both direct services to our members and to become a powerful voice for creator interests in the broader society. We believe that by uniting creators across disciplines—from authors and artists to scientists and programmers—we can create a more sustainable, equitable creative ecosystem for all.

## Join Our Movement

Whether you're a creator seeking better protections, a technologist interested in building ethical systems, an advocate for creative rights, or simply someone who values fairly compensated creative work, there's a place for you in our movement.

Together, we can build a future where creativity is valued, creators are respected, and the entire ecosystem benefits from fair, transparent, and sustainable practices.
