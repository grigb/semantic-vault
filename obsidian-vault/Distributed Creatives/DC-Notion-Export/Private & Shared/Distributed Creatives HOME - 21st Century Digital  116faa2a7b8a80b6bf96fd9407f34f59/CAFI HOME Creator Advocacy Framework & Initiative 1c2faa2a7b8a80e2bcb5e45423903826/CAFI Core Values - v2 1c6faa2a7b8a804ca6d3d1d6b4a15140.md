# CAFI Core Values - v2

## Principles for Distributed Creatives

1. **United Creator Voice** - We unite creators across all disciplines—from visual artists and musicians to writers and knowledge creators—to amplify our collective power while respecting the unique needs of each creative field. We partner with discipline-specific organizations to strengthen the entire creator ecosystem.
2. **Technology in Service of Creativity** - We develop practical technological solutions that empower creators to maintain ownership of their work, track its usage, receive fair compensation, and preserve their creative legacy. Our tools address immediate needs while supporting long-term career sustainability.
3. **Fair Value Exchange** - We advocate for systems where the economic and cultural value generated by creative works flows primarily to their creators. We recognize that fair compensation isn't just about higher percentages—it's about restructuring how creative work is valued, licensed, and monetized across all platforms, including AI training.
4. **Creator Sovereignty and Autonomy** - We defend the right of creators to determine how their work is used, shared, and monetized. We build frameworks that give creators control over their intellectual property and their relationships with audiences, free from exploitative platforms and intermediaries.
5. **Transparent and Accessible Ecosystem** - We promote clear, understandable terms for creative work and build systems that make both creating and accessing creative content more equitable. We believe knowledge and creativity should be accessible while ensuring creators are fairly compensated.
6. **Global Community, Local Impact** - We build connections among creators worldwide while supporting community-based initiatives that address local needs. We recognize that creator challenges vary by region and culture, requiring both global advocacy and localized solutions.
7. **Legacy and Preservation** - We develop infrastructure for preserving creative works for future generations, ensuring continued attribution and compensation. Unlike current archival approaches vulnerable to corporate decisions or platform changes, our distributed solutions maintain permanent access with proper licensing intact.
