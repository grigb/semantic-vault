# A Declaration for Creators in the Digital Age

In today's digital landscape, creators face unprecedented challenges: AI systems trained on our work without permission, complex value chains directing profits away from creators, and technological systems designed to replace rather than empower human creativity.

Despite these challenges, we envision a future where creators thrive through fair compensation, ownership of their work, and meaningful connections with their audiences—a creative ecosystem built on transparency, choice, and respect.

**Distributed Creatives** is a global community dedicated to building this future through these core principles:

**United Creator Voice** – We unite creators across all disciplines to amplify our collective power while respecting each creative field's unique needs. Together with discipline-specific organizations, we strengthen the entire creator ecosystem.

**Technology in Service of Creativity** – We develop practical tools that empower creators to maintain ownership, track usage, receive fair compensation, and preserve their creative legacy—ensuring technology serves creators rather than exploiting them.

**Fair Value Exchange** – We advocate for systems where the value generated by creative works flows primarily to their creators, including fair compensation for AI training and ethical frameworks that respect creator rights.

**Creator Sovereignty** – We defend creators' rights to determine how their work is used, shared, and monetized, building frameworks that give creators control over their intellectual property and audience relationships.

**Transparent and Accessible Ecosystem** – We promote clear terms for creative work and build systems making both creating and accessing content more equitable, rejecting opaque contracts and hidden algorithms.

**Global Community, Local Impact** – We connect creators worldwide while supporting community-based initiatives, recognizing that creator challenges vary by region and require both global advocacy and local solutions.

**Legacy and Preservation** – We develop infrastructure preserving creative works for future generations with attribution and compensation, using distributed solutions that maintain permanent access with proper licensing.

By joining Distributed Creatives, you become part of a community transforming how creative work is valued, protected, and shared. Our membership model provides both individual benefits and collective advocacy power, combining immediate practical support with long-term systemic change.

The future of creativity depends on creators standing together. Join us in building a world where creative work is properly valued, creators maintain their rights, and technology serves human expression rather than replacing it.
