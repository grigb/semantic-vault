# Partnership Development Strategy

# **Distributed Creatives** Partnership Development Strategy

Based on your research of creative organizations and considering your unique approach with local integrations like digital signage in Boulder, I've developed a comprehensive partnership strategy that leverages both traditional and innovative approaches.

## Partnership Criteria: Organizations That Align with Core Values partnership criteria

### Core Value Alignment Assessment

When evaluating potential partners, assess their alignment with Distributed Creatives' seven core principles:

1. **United Creator Voice**: Do they support cross-disciplinary creator collaboration?
2. **Technology in Service of Creativity**: Do they leverage technology to empower rather than exploit creators?
3. **Fair Value Exchange**: Do they advocate for fair compensation and value flow to creators?
4. **Creator Sovereignty**: Do they promote creator control over their work?
5. **Transparent and Accessible Ecosystem**: Do they advocate for transparency and accessibility?
6. **Global Community, Local Impact**: Do they balance global advocacy with local support?
7. **Legacy and Preservation**: Do they value long-term preservation of creative works?

### Additional Partnership Criteria

Beyond value alignment, consider:

- **Track Record**: Organizations with demonstrated commitment to creator rights
