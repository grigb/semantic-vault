Project Forever Sites

Issue: 

Artists have been maintaining their sites, and when they pass, if they are lucky, someone else maintains them for them. In many cases, these sites go down, and the links to external sites change.

Places like the WayBackMachine are subject to attack because the are still centralized

Solution: 

Use Arweave and other long-term file storage strategies to store data forever, including current sites and metadata for generating new sites from the core media required to store all the content
