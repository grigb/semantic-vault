**Customer Needs**

Below is a profile of the needs that our target customers have:

- Quality: A platform that has the artist in mind from the very beginning. Designing it in a way that gives them the tools to build a successful working business as an artist, while cultivating the audience for them to share their work with and convert to fans. Current platforms aren’t bringing an audience to the table; it's still on the artists plate to bring the audience to their work. We will be not only cultivating an audience for them to tap into, it will be an audience that is onboard with our mission of empowering independent artists thus creating a warm target audience that we give them access too.

For our audience we will be providing the best in independent talent and a way to connect with them directly. We will be producing live events at venues all over the city creating a fun and creative community for them to live in. They will be able to deepen those relationships on our website in the paid members section. It will become a true community and make it very easy to organize your friends to experience the local creative offerings we help facilitate through our digital infrastructure.

For the local independent venues we will be helping them promote their shows and facilitate the connections to talent creating a pipeline that serves all parties in a win-win situation. Along with all the other businesses in the local art ecosystem such as record labels and recording studios who will have an active audience to expose their work too and a roster of talent looking to book their services.

- Location: Being a radio station we can be with our customers at almost all times. Audio is a form of content that is incredibly versatile and easily accessible. We will be working with many different independent venues in the city making it easy to attend one of our events.
- Reliability: We will be available for our audience to listen to us 24/7 365. We will be their connection to the creative community they live in.
- Comfort: They will be able to tune in from wherever they are with ease.
- Price: Our base member fee will only be $10 a month making it easily accessible to the community of Boulder.
- Value: Not only will we be providing great content that inspires our audience and aids them on their journey of artistic discovery we will be contributing 3% of every membership fee into a fund that is paid out to support artists in the community. It creates a system that sustains the arts while providing the platform for distribution and fan development. Once we reach a high level of monthly members there will be an abundance of financial resources that are given out to artists. This creates a model that provides for the empowerment of the entire art ecosystem which will radiate out to the other sectors of the local economy. More people going out to shows will mean more people going out to restaurants and visiting other businesses throughout the community as they are out on the town.
- Customer Service: By focusing on such a small community for launch we can conduct surveys that reach the city at large to provide feedback about our services and how we can improve them. We will be working through pain points of the local art industry from the bottom up so that we can develop solutions from direct experience with direct feedback.

- Ease of use: All that is required to use our product is a device with an internet connection. Since we’re initially audio based our audience can tune in while performing a wide variety of tasks.

# **Competitive Analysis**

## **Competitive Analysis: Navigating the Boulder Art Scene Landscape**

Distributed Creatives enters the Boulder art scene with a unique offering: a platform amplifying local voices, fostering community connection, and empowering the art ecosystem. While traditional art industry businesses focus on one aspect of the industry, Distributed Creatives carves a distinct niche through:

**1. Artistic Diversity:** Beyond the mainstream operations, Distributed Creatives promises to be a platform that fosters a vibrant tapestry of creative expression. This caters to a wider range of interests, fosters a deeper connection with the creative process, and sets us apart from the algorithm-driven monotony of mainstream industry.

**2. Community Hub:** Partnerships with local arts organizations, diverse events across Boulder County, and 45% of membership fees directly supporting artists solidify Distributed Creatives commitment to the art community. This builds fierce loyalty and attracts an audience who seek not just an art experience, but genuine engagement and the thrill of being part of a thriving, supportive network.

**3. Proven Demand:** The presence of three existing listener-supported radio stations that can be tuned into in Boulder County validates the demand for an alternative approach to curation and discovery of dynamic creative content. Distributed Creatives hyper-local focus and dedication to the art scene positions us to capture a distinct audience within this existing market, offering something the others can't: a platform where local artists are not just heard, but celebrated and empowered.

**Competitive Landscape:**

**KGNU:** This Boulder-based listener-supported station boasts a rich history and diverse programming. However, resource limitations may hinder event production and marketing efforts. Distributed Creatives can capitalize on its fresh energy and strategic partnerships to attract a new, engaged audience, while respecting the legacy KGNU has built.

**Spotify**:While Spotify is a major competitor, Distributed Creatives differentiates itself through its hyper-local focus, community-driven platform, direct artist support, curated content, and event production expertise. This allows Distributed Creatives to offer a personalized and community-centric alternative to Spotify's mass-market approach.

**Z2 Entertainment:** This major concert promoter excels in event production but lacks a dedicated radio platform. Distributed Creatives bridges this gap. We offer artists a valuable platform for promotion and interaction, that takes the fan to artist engagement out of the venue and into their everyday lives.

**Internal Strengths:**

- **Passionate Team:** Experienced professionals with a shared love for the arts fuel Distributed Creatives vision and drive. We are not just a business team; we are advocates and collaborators, building genuine connections with artists and listeners alike.
- **Financial Stability:** A well-defined plan ensures long-term viability, attracting listeners and artists who value sustainability. We offer a reliable platform for expression and support, unlike stations struggling to make ends meet.
