# Boulder LAN Roadmap

### **Vision and Market Opportunity**

The Local Artists Network (LAN) is a nonprofit initiative designed to revolutionize the creative economy by directly connecting artists, venues, and audiences through a digital platform. We are launching our beta test in Boulder, CO, a city consistently ranked as one of the top 10 creative communities in the U.S. Boulder offers a unique combination of a tightly-knit arts community, an audience eager for cultural engagement, and a supportive municipal environment that is actively fostering artistic growth. With a target audience of 84,941 individuals, our baseline membership fee of $5/month creates a scalable model with significant growth potential. By reinvesting 65% of revenue into the local creative economy through artist sponsorships, grants, and event production, LAN not only supports community creativity but also builds a sustainable feedback loop that strengthens the platform’s value proposition over time.

### **Financial Projections and Growth Strategy**

Launching in May 2025, LAN's beta test will begin with a focused membership acquisition strategy, including community round tables, guerrilla marketing, and direct engagement with artists and venues. Our projections indicate achievable membership growth rates, ranging from 3% to 40% of our target audience by the end of Year 1, equating to 2,548 to 33,976 members. This translates to monthly revenue potential between $12,740 and $169,880. By maintaining operational efficiency (35% of revenue allocated to staffing and maintenance) and reinvesting the majority of funds into community-driven projects, LAN will rapidly build trust and momentum within Boulder’s creative ecosystem. With its scalable infrastructure, LAN is poised to expand into similar communities, creating a replicable model for transforming local arts economies nationwide. Our investor partnerships will be pivotal in accelerating this vision and ensuring Distributed Creatives becomes the go-to platform for the 21st-century creative economy.

The goal of the Beta launch in Boulder is to deeply understand and optimize the commercial flows of the local art economy, creating a sustainable system that benefits artists, venues, and audiences alike. By analyzing how money, resources, and engagement circulate within Boulder’s creative ecosystem, we aim to identify the most impactful strategies to maximize its potential. This data-driven approach will allow us to fine-tune the LAN model, ensuring it meets the unique needs of artists and community members while driving meaningful economic growth.

Once the Boulder model has been perfected, it will serve as a blueprint for expanding LAN to other creative communities. By replicating the proven framework, we can effectively implement the same strategies in new markets, adapting to their local cultural and economic nuances. This scalable approach ensures that LAN will empower artists and revitalize art economies in cities nationwide, using Boulder as the foundation for long-term success.

The Beta launch of the LAN in Boulder is designed to replicate the proven success of companies like Airbnb and Uber, which began at a localized level, perfected their models, and used those foundations to scale globally. By focusing on Boulder—a city renowned for its vibrant creative community and small enough to effectively test strategies—we can deeply analyze and optimize the commercial flows of the local art economy. This approach allows us to identify key drivers of success, refine our platform, and ensure that it delivers maximum value to artists, venues, and audiences.

Just as Airbnb started by connecting hosts and travelers in a single city and Uber began by testing rideshare logistics in one urban market, LAN is developing a model tailored to Boulder’s unique needs. By perfecting our platform in this setting, we’ll gain the insights and operational expertise necessary to scale effectively. With a proven framework, LAN can expand into other creative communities, empowering artists and revitalizing art economies on a national and eventually global scale. This localized-to-global strategy ensures that every step we take strengthens the platform’s foundation and amplifies its long-term impact.
