# Local Artist Network: Project Overview

# Vision

A digital infrastructure that overlays a local art ecosystem and networks artists, art enthusiasts and art related businesses. It will provide all the tools and resources to develop a working career and operate an art related business in the 21st century while building real world relationships in the communities where artists and organizations are working. With a digital infrastructure each LAN will be integrated into a global network whose power is distributed from the bottom up.

Components of a LAN

- Digital Signage
- Promotion for Financial Support
- Event Broadcasts
- Featured Artwork
- Virtual hub
- Multi-media organization that promotes network

# Overview

What is the project? Why are we working on this? 

This project is developing the infrastructure that will support a local art economy to network amongst itself. It will be the watering hole for artists, art enthusiasts and art related businesses to weave relationships that will help facilitate commerce for the economy. The goal is to create a model that creates a road map for an individual to go from art curious to working career. It will be developed using blockchain technology giving an artist all the tools to be in control of all their rights along with distribution and community management. 

Where working on this because developing an art career has traditionally been dependent on wealthy benefactors and more recently for profit organizations, who siphoned the majority of the value out of the ecosystem, offering the real value creators crumbs from the financial success, while simultaneously dictating what they create. Art is a fundamental aspect of being human and brings us together as community. To create an infrastructure that is decentralized with power distributed from the bottom up will allow art to be liberated into it’s highest ideal, while simultaneously providing a frame work for humans to organize around creative endeavors instead of destructive ones.  

### Problem Statement

With the digital era we’ve got more tools then ever before to build a career but having to fight the noise on social media with every influencer of every niche is an uphill battle that’s almost impossible to navigate as a solo artist. The platforms want them to spend months and years on the platform grinding to build an audience, not to earn their way to value but time spent on the platform means advertising dollars. Then once the audience is established the artist doesn’t even have full access to them because the platforms want ads to be purchased.

Problems 

- Social media is really noisy
    - Finding the signal is very hard, and leads to option fatigue (ever looked for a movie to watch, and given up? Creators in every form and genre suffer from this)
- Don’t have full access to audience
    - Dominator platforms filter, limit and monetize reach that isn’t guaranteed even when you pay top dollar ad rates
- Every niche present in one space
- Takes many months to years just to build an audience
- Platforms are designed to keep you on them
- Siloed off from the rest of the internet
- Artists not in control of their work
- Current organizations extract value from the ecosystem and offer very little back

### Proposed Solution

Develop a digital infrastructure that overlays a local art ecosystem that networks and promotes the different aspects of it. It will be a one stop shop that offers all the tools an artist, art enthusiast or art related business will need to be a participant in a thriving creative ecosystem. By offering a platform that is art specific and locally focused it will create a smaller more focused pool for artists to launch a career and acquire an initial fan base. With local art related businesses on board it will create a network effect that gives these artists a real world opportunity to develop their career and grow their skills, while getting exposure to potential new fans. As the infrastructure is digital it will inherently be connected to a global audience available 24/7 365 which these emerging artists will be able to tap into. It will be built to be federated, open source with blockchain technology, to give a platform that is designed to empower art culture not extract from it.

# Success Criteria

1-3 sentences on what success for the project looks like. Include metrics and qualitative descriptors if relevant. 

This project looks like a local community of around 100k having a vibrant and active art ecosystem with tens of thousands of active participants virtually and physically. Artists are able to build an initial fan base that is willing to invest their financial resources into the work. The city is a model for what an art economy can look like in the 21st century in a fashion that empowers artists instead of extracting from them.

# User Stories

What will the user be able to do after the solution is shipped? 

- Discover new art in their local community with ease
- Connect with other art enthusiasts online and offline to strengthen community bonds
- Operate an independent art related business and have a direct market for new clients and audience to promote the clients work too
- Develop real world experience as an artist to hone skills
- Access to mentors in the art industry to help grow career
- Develop initial audience that supports with financial resources
