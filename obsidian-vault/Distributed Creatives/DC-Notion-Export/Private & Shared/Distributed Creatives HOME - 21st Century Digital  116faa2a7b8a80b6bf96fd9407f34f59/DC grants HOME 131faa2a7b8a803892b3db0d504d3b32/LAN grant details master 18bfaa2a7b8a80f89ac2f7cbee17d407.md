## Technological Innovation

The Local Artist Network combines low-cost digital signage displays, a creator-first social network, custom smart TV apps, and cutting-edge streaming technologies for multicasting. This innovative approach seamlessly integrates local creators into public spaces, fosters direct artist-audience connections, and supports high-quality live event streaming. By harnessing these technologies, the LAN creates a dynamic, accessible platform for showcasing and experiencing local creators. The public is encouraged to support creators directly through the website via QR codes and creator profiles.

## **Demographics Data**

- Information on the population served by your programs, including diversity metrics.
    - **About digital signage impressions:** The LAN plans to integrate digital signage impressions for a diverse range of needs. Impressions are scheduled, displayed, managed, and tracked across all participating locations. With an average of 1440 impressions per day, the LAN can guarantee fair support of all parties
    - **Serving Local Creators:** A majority of the impressions (70% or more) are reserved for creators to display their creations. Each will link (with QR codes) to their page on the Musely (a social platform run by Distributed Creatives).
    - **Serving Tribal Nations:** Digital signage impressions showcasing the history of tribal nations in Boulder, CO, and any additional information to be supplied by the city of Boulder.
    - **Serving Youth:** Ongoing updates for youth art opportunities, such as CU Boulder, YOAB, and youth opportunities in projects
        - Add statistics about how this changes lives
    - **Serving Minorities:** Ongoing updates for minorities [need more detail here]
    - **Serving Boulder Communities:** Ongoing updates for Boulder communities [need more detail here]
    - **Serving Alert Networks:** Support for broadcasting climate alerts
    - **Serving Sponsors:** The majority of the cost of running the LAN will be paid for by the sponsors, including public, private, and corporate. Ideally there would be support from grants and the city, but we are also planning to provide limited space to corporate sponsorship in the form of a small banner at the bottom of some impressions.

**Environmental Impact Statement**

- Required for some grants, especially those related to land use or sustainability.

1. **Project Budget**
    - A detailed breakdown of costs associated with the specific project for which you’re requesting funding.
    - Include a line-item budget and any matching funds or in-kind contributions.
2. **Timeline or Work Plan**
    - A clear schedule of project milestones, deliverables, and deadlines.
3. **Logic Model or Theory of Change**
    - A visual or narrative explanation of how your project will create the desired outcomes.
    - Include inputs, activities, outputs, and expected outcomes.

6. **Social Return on Investment (SROI)**
    - SROI is a framework that assigns monetary values to the social and environmental outcomes of a nonprofit's initiatives, allowing stakeholders to understand the value created relative to the investment made.
    - For instance, if a nonprofit invests in a job training program, the SROI would measure not only the direct employment outcomes but also the broader societal benefits, such as reduced unemployment benefits and increased tax revenues.
