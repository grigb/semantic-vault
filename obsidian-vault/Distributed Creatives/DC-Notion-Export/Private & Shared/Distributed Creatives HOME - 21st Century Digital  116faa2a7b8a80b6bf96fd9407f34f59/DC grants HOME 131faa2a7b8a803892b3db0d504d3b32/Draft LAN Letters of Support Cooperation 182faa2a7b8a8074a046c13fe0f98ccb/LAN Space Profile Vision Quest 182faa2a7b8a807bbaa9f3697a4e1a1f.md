# Current Challenges

- The owners of vision quest have worked for a very long time in the Boulder community and have expressed their concern with the changing landscape.
- The Covid crisis prevented an entire generation from learning to discover what it's like to go out for the night. They became a culture that stayed indoors.
- Because of the rising cost of Boulder housing, locals can't afford to go out.
- Those that can afford to go out, tend to go to Denver for entertainment.
- They see a real need for communities to learn what it's like to have a social life and experience culture together in community spaces

## Specific cultural/artistic challenges in their area

- Booking events with enough of an audience to break even on rental costs
- People don’t go out much
- People don’t know how about their events
- People in Boulder don't know what's going on around them

## Current methods of attracting customers/audience

- Working with locals they have built a relationship with who have projects and work friendly arrangements at a reduced rate
- People walking in off the street
- Locals who work nearby sometimes stop in.
- Outdoor events during the summer attract people who can see or hear them from the highway nearby

## Existing participation in community

- They support local and regional live music, poetry readings, flea markets, DJs, electronic music producers
