| **Proof of concept** | The project leverages local artist networks and community building to support its mission. The Local Artists Network (LAN) and Musely initiatives are designed to foster a thriving creative community by connecting artists, venues, and audiences through innovative networking tools and local engagement. The LAN will provide a platform where artists can showcase their work, collaborate with peers, and directly engage with venues and audiences. Musely complements this by offering community-driven event coordination and resource-sharing capabilities, ensuring that artists have access to the tools and opportunities they need to succeed. Two venues are already committed to installing the LAN system, which demonstrates early buy-in and proof of the model’s scalability. Together, these programs aim to build an interconnected ecosystem that supports creative expression and sustainable artistic careers. |

The arts and culture sector is a significant contributor to the U.S. economy, adding approximately $804 billion in 2016, with independent artists, writers, and performers contributing $22 billion.

Despite their contributions, artists often face financial instability. In 2020, the unemployment rate for artists was 10.3%, higher than the 7.8% rate for the total workforce. ([americansforthearts.org](https://www.americansforthearts.org/by-program/reports-and-data/legislation-policy/naappd/artists-in-the-us-workforce-2006-2020?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) Additionally, only 1 in 6 artists earns more than $25,000 annually, and 1 in 10 earns more than $100,000.

To address these challenges, our organization focuses on key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure our impact:

1. **Investment in the Community**: We track the total funds allocated to support local artists and cultural initiatives, aiming to enhance economic development and provide financial stability for artists.

2. **Art Sales on Our Platform**: Monitoring the volume and value of artworks sold through our platform helps assess our role in promoting artists' work and providing them with sustainable income.

3. **Ticket Sales to Local Shows**: By tracking ticket sales for events at local venues, we gauge community engagement and the effectiveness of our promotional efforts in driving attendance.

4. **Impressions on Signage and Creative Content**: Measuring the reach of our marketing materials, both physical and digital, allows us to understand our visibility and the potential impact on audience engagement.

Implementing these KPIs enables us to evaluate our effectiveness in supporting artists and addressing the financial challenges they face, ultimately contributing to a more vibrant and sustainable arts community.  |
