# Distributed Creatives Strategic Plan & Operational Roadmap (2025-2028)

## Executive Summary

Distributed Creatives was founded in 2024 to transform how communities engage with art by creating sustainable economic opportunities for creators in the digital age. Unlike commercial platforms that extract value from creators, we structured as a nonprofit to develop Boulder's creative infrastructure as a public good. Our core strategy is simple yet revolutionary: by giving creators and communities 100% of their earnings, we provide the most attractive alternative to every existing corporate creative platform. This ensures rapid adoption, global scalability, and long-term sustainability, making Distributed Creatives the preferred choice for artists, musicians, writers, designers, and all creative professionals.

Additionally, we are skipping over a decade of development time by leveraging off-the-shelf and open-source software, allowing us to implement powerful features immediately rather than spending years building from scratch. By combining existing high-quality solutions with custom integrations, we maximize efficiency while maintaining total control over revenue distribution—ensuring that creators always retain 100% of what they earn.

This strategic plan and operational roadmap outline our phased approach to building a robust creative ecosystem in Boulder and beyond, leveraging innovative technology to connect creators, venues, and audiences in meaningful ways. By prioritizing local-to-national-to-global scaling, Distributed Creatives will establish an interconnected network of Local Artist Networks (LANs) that will ultimately redefine the global creator economy.

## Vision & Mission

### Vision

To create a world where creators of all disciplines—artists, writers, musicians, performers, digital innovators, and makers—can build sustainable careers through community-driven support systems that preserve creative independence and foster cultural vitality.

### Mission

We're building a 21st-century creator economy as a public good. In an era where government support dwindles and corporations increasingly control creative opportunities, we harness emerging technologies to empower the rising creator class. We believe creators—artists, writers, musicians, scientists, innovators, and makers of all kinds—represent a new economic force that can thrive through community-driven infrastructure. By building free tools and spaces where creators maintain control of their work and earnings, we're helping communities reclaim their creative economy from extractive corporate platforms. By ensuring 100% of all earnings go directly to creators, we eliminate corporate gatekeepers and make Distributed Creatives the single most attractive creative economy worldwide.
