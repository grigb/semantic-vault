## Organization/General

In just six months, Distributed Creatives has made impressive strides in establishing itself as a transformative force in the creative economy. From securing its nonprofit status to preparing for product launches and fostering strategic partnerships, the organization has laid a robust foundation for future growth and impact.

Weâ€™ve obtained our 501(c)(3) status, solidifying Distributed Creatives as a nonprofit committed to serving the creative community. Alongside this, the organization established a diverse and experienced board of directors, whose collective expertise provides guidance and ensures alignment with its mission.

During this foundational period, Distributed Creatives developed its initial suite of products, including the Musely social media platform and minting tools for composable NFTs. These tools are now ready for launch, promising to empower artists with innovative ways to share, monetize, and collaborate on their creative work.

In parallel, the organization secured multiple venues to participate in its Local Artists Network (LAN). These spaces will host our digital signage and a variety of creative events, from stakeholder round tables to open mics and multi-medium art experiences, bridging the gap between digital tools and real-world engagement to weave together a creative community that is empowered to thrive.

To further its mission, Distributed Creatives has organized its first Creative Culture and Tech conference, set to take place in July. This event will bring together thought leaders from diverse fields to explore topics such as regenerative culture, governance, and the intersection of technology and creativity, positioning the organization as a leader in the conversation about the future of the arts.

These achievements underscore Distributed Creativesâ€™ rapid progress and commitment to creating a sustainable, inclusive, and innovative ecosystem for the creative economy. The organization is poised to expand its impact as it builds upon this strong foundation.

## LAN

The Local Artists Network (LAN) is a cornerstone initiative of Distributed Creatives, designed to bridge the gap between artists, venues, and communities through innovative digital infrastructure and real-world collaboration. Currently, the back-end technology to support LAN is under active development, with plans to have the platform fully operational by mid-March.

Two venues have already signed on for installations, reflecting strong early support for the project. These spaces will host the digital signage along with a range of creative offerings, including stakeholder round tables, multi-medium art experiences, and open mics, creating vibrant hubs for local artistic engagement.

Conversations are also underway with a growing number of artists interested in joining the platform. LAN will empower artists to connect with audiences, showcase their work, and collaborate with venues directly, streamlining the creative process and fostering new opportunities for exposure and income.

The first installations are planned for late March, marking a significant milestone in LANâ€™s rollout. With this foundation, LAN aims to become a transformative tool for building stronger, more connected local art communities.

## Musely

Musely is Distributed Creativesâ€™ premiere social media platform, built to empower creatives,  venues and audiences with a digital space to connect, collaborate, and showcase their work. The platform is fully operational and ready to onboard users, with processes for a seamless launch currently in development.

Musely is already generating excitement, with numerous artists and venues expressing interest in joining. These early adopters will provide a solid initial user base, enabling the platform to gain traction and build brand awareness as more creatives discover its potential.

Aligned with the rollout of the Local Artists Network (LAN), every artist on boarded to the LAN will receive a dedicated Musely profile. Art showcased in LAN installations will feature QR codes that link directly to the artistâ€™s Musely profile, enhancing their visibility and demonstrating the platformâ€™s value as a tool for creative empowerment. By connecting audiences to artistsâ€™ digital portfolios, Musely not only drives engagement but also positions itself as a key element of Distributed Creativesâ€™ mission to uplift and support independent creative culture.

## Initial progress

## Distributed Creatives has made substantial progress in its early development, establishing a strong foundation for its mission to transform the art economy through innovation, sustainability, and community engagement. Key milestones achieved include:

- **Musely Social Media Platform**: The platform is fully operational, offering a digital space designed exclusively for creatives to share, collaborate, and connect. An initial small, invite-only launch is planned to cultivate a focused user base, test features, and gain valuable feedback, setting the stage for a broader community rollout.
- **Minting Tools for Composable NFTs**: Advanced tools for minting composable NFTs have been developed and deployed. These tools empower artists by providing lifetime royalties, provenance, and limitless remixing capabilities, enabling new forms of cultural exploration and collaboration. This innovative approach positions Distributed Creatives at the forefront of merging blockchain technology with the arts.
- **Efficient Architecture**: The organizationâ€™s platforms are built using off-the-shelf software, which has significantly reduced startup costs while ensuring scalability and rapid development. This strategic choice allows Distributed Creatives to maintain low overhead and focus resources on delivering impactful tools and services to the creative community.
- **Operational Server**: A dedicated server is already live, providing a reliable infrastructure to support the platformâ€™s functionalities and ensure seamless user experiences.
- **Venues Secured**: Two venues have been signed on as part of the Local Artists Network (LAN), providing opportunities for in-person events such as stakeholder roundtables, multi-medium art showcases, open mics, and industry nights. These spaces will serve as physical extensions of the platform, fostering real-world engagement and creative collaboration.
- **Artist Engagement in the Pilot Program**: A growing number of artists have expressed enthusiasm for participating in the pilot phase of Distributed Creatives. Leveraging 13 years of the teamâ€™s experience and extensive connections within the Boulder art community, the organization is well-positioned to expand outreach and onboard a diverse group of creatives.
- **Creative Culture and Tech Conference**: The first Creative Culture and Tech conference is scheduled for July in the Sacramento Delta, approximately an hour south of San Francisco. This event will feature panels on topics such as regenerative culture, governance and future coordination, long-term data preservation for cultural history, and the importance of artist communities. The conference will also include a keynote presentation about Distributed Creatives and will bring together thought leaders and innovators in the fields of art and technology.

These achievements reflect the organizationâ€™s readiness to foster systemic change in the art economy, connecting technology, creativity, and community to build a thriving ecosystem for artists and art enthusiasts.
