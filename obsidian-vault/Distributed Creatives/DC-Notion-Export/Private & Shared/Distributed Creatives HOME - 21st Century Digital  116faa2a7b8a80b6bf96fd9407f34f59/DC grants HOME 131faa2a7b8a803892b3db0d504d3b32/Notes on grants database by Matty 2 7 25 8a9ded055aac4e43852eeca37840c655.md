# Notes on grants database by Matty 2/7/25

- SCFD requires 5 years of operations to be eligible. We should reach out to see if there’s any wiggle room on this.
- Create Boulder doesn’t give out grants directly they provide funds to bolster the Boulder City Grants. We need to make friends with this org asap. They have connections to a lot of donors and with our goal of providing grants could get this org to contribute some their resources into grants on our platform.
- Visit Boulder, website doesn’t have any information about grants. Needs a direct contact. Here’s an email Emiliano.Lake-Herrera@bouldercvb.com
- Boulder Chamber didn’t mention anything about grants. But we can become a member for $385 a year and will open a bunch of doors for networking. We should do this asap.
- Colorado Creates-we’re ineligible because we haven’t held public programs for 2 years and had 25k in operational budget the previous year
- Community Foundation of Boulder. We’re eligible. Application’s due April 1st- May1st. 3k-9k in funding. We need to send an email
- Boulder County Alliance for the Arts. General operating grant. 1k-3k will open sometime this spring. We’re eligible
- Human relations Fund of Boulder. For events didn’t give specifics on amount. Currently closed and had confusing language for when it opens.
