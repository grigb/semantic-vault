# Notes On Summit Grant team research

Robert Lehman foundation- Up to $7,500- Related to our work, Specifically for visual arts and education to under represented voices. I think this could be something that the LAN could support. Building educational programming on the app that can serve as education for kids. Potentially focusing on the artists of their specific communities. We use the $7,500 to pay people from the communities to create educational programming.(Just trying to come up with an idea that could align) 

Community Trust- $3k-$9k- pretty vague what they’re looking for. says anything arts related that works in Boulder county. Definitely need to apply. April 1st applications open

VIA ART Fund- $25k-$100K - By invite only. Letter of inquiry due by May 15th. If invited applications open June 18th due by July 17th. Grant focused on exhibitions beyond museum walls in public space, these projects feature high levels of thought leadership, artistic production, and public engagement.

El Pomar- $2,500-10k-  Specifically listed an emphasized interest in arts and culture among other key interests. Denver Metro area more competitive then more economically depressed regions. Projects with established community support are more likely to get funds. Rolling submissions. Have to wait 3 years to apply again after successfully winning a grant. 

First National Bank Omaha-Unspecified- They don’t say much except that the support through sponsorship and Capital or  Major Donation. For sponsorship they will do about anything. There’s a season sponsorship for arts organizations. There also impact grants that are different then this program. One of them is for Work force development and Entrepreneurship. With our focus on the development of the creative economy I think we could get something like this. Would also support our thesis of the development of the creative class. 

Indigo Oak Fund- unspecified- We have to send an inquiry to know more about the program
