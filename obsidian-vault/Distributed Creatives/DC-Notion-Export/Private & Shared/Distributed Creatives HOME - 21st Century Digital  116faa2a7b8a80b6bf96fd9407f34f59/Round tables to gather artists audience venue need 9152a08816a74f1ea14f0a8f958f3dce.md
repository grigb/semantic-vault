# Round tables to gather artists/audience/venue needs

### Facilitating Stakeholder Round Tables for Distributed Creatives: Product Development Insights

**Overview:**

To develop a platform that authentically serves the needs of the art community, Distributed Creatives will hold round tables that bring together its three core stakeholder groups—artists, art enthusiasts, and art-related businesses—in Boulder, CO, and online. Each group will meet separately to ensure focused feedback and tailored discussions that address the specific needs and aspirations of each stakeholder group. These round tables will also build relationships, collect contact information for potential users, and offer a preview of our platform’s capabilities and mission. Local restaurants will sponsor the event catering to enrich the experience and support the community.
