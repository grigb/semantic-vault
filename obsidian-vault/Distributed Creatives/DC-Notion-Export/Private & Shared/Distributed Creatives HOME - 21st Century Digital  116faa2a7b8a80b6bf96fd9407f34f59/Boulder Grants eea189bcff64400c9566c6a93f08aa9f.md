Deadlines for grant applications

January 1, 2025. These are awarded on a first come, first served basis (high priority want to submit by end of next week. I’m contacting grant writers now that were listed on Boulder’s website. We need one committed before we submit)

General operating support-Wednesday, February 12 at 11:59 p.m. – Deadline for applications 8.8k

Community project grant-Wednesday, March 12 at 11:59 p.m  10k

We will consult with the grant writer about which of these we’re most aligned with. I’m fairly certain we’re aligned with both of them and should submit to each one. If we received both of them we would get $18,800 in funding
