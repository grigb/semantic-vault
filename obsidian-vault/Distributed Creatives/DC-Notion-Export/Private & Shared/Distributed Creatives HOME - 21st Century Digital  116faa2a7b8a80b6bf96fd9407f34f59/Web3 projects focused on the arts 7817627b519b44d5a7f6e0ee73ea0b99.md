DCP runs a fund that is democratically managed and allocated towards projects, funded by token sales, donations, and revenues from DCP financed films. Users can submit film proposals for review by community members, and can integrate offers of NFTs of their IP, a line in the credits, role opportunities, merchandise, or other rewards as well. Reviewers are awarded Film credit tokens for evaluating and rating proposals that increase their community reputation score, which can make them eligible to become community moderators.

[Royal](https://royal.io/) is a music rights marketplace 
that allows audiences to invest in music they support and co-earn 
royalties with artists, jointly participating in financial upsides.

During
 artist drops, audience members can buy tokens representing a percentage
 of the music’s streaming rights across major platforms such as Spotify.
 Token purchase also facilitates new forms of audience engagement — 
artists can attach extra benefits such as exclusive tracks, merch, or 
fan experiences, and token holders can show their support with wallet 
holdings. Tokens — along with any unclaimed extras and future royalties —
 can be sold at any time, and can appreciate in value with the 
popularity of artists and songs. Royal allows artists to retain 
independence and creative control, allowing artists to set the 
percentage of ownership available for purchase.

There are 9,200 current token holders. As of June 2023, Royal reports that its partnered
 artists have paid out over $156,000 in royalties to collectors; raised 
$2.5 million for artists; and seen $7.5 million in music rights traded 
across 111 countries.

Built on the Ethereum Network, [Shibuya](https://www.shibuya.xyz/)
 is creating a new model for crowdfunding, building community around, 
and co-creating creative content. Long-form content is free to watch, 
but through the sale of NFT “producer passes” people who invest share 
ownership and have access to participate in the creative process.

The
 dominant studio model precludes access to resources for many creators, 
and removes audiences and fans from the creative process. Shibuya seeks 
to provide a range of tools and resources to help creators produce 
high-quality content, and provide them with direct access to their 
audiences, thus building deep connections with their fans that allows 
them to develop a loyal following.

The short film White Rabbit is 
the first in-house IP on Shibuya, released as an interactive series 
about going down the crypto rabbit hole. While anyone can stream the 
series, token holders get unique privileges to support production and to
 vote on the plot of the series. To date, there are 1,656 active holders
 of producer passes for Shibuya’s first interactive web series, all with
 voting privileges.

[https://landing.arpeggi.io/](https://landing.arpeggi.io/)

Built on Polygon, [Arpeggi](https://landing.arpeggi.io/) 
is a music and audio creation platform that provides Web3 tooling for 
collaboration within the music industry, to facilitate music creators’ 
access to a library of licensed samples, remix licenses, and tools to 
support attributions and minting of NFTs that can in turn be used by 
other artists.

The platform includes a marketplace for music 
samples and remix licenses, which allows creators to support and connect
 directly with other artists while receiving royalty-free, 
commercial-use license for the sounds in the Kit. It also includes 
digital studio software that automatically integrates on-chain sound 
libraries, licensing processes, and tools to mint creations as NFTs and 
credit samples. To date, the project has onboarded over 5,100 artists, 
and minted over 6,000 songs and over 20,000 sounds.
