    Slide 2: Problem/Opportunity
    
    Title: Problem/OpportunityProblem Statement:"Creatives are overwhelmed by the complexity and cost of managing multiple platforms for creation, distribution, and monetization, detracting from their core creative work and reducing their earnings."
    
    Content
    
    This statement summarizes the key challenges:
    
    - Creatives must juggle numerous platforms (e.g., one for creating content, another for memberships, another for social engagement, email lists, sales, etc.), each with its own learning curve and subscription fee.
    - Emerging technologies like blockchain and web3 add further complexity.
    - Instead of focusing on their creative work, creatives end up spending time and money managing a marketing operation, while platforms take a cut of their earnings.
    
    Imagery Suggestion
    
    Visual: An image of a juggler struggling to keep multiple balls in the air, with each ball labeled to represent a different platform (e.g., "Creation," "Membership," "Social," "Email," "Sales," "Blockchain").Why it works: This vivid metaphor captures the overwhelming multitasking creatives face, making the problem instantly relatable and memorable. The labeled balls tie directly to the variety of platforms mentioned, emphasizing the chaotic balancing act.

    Slide 3: Value Proposition
    
    Content
    
    Title: Value PropositionHeadline: "Empower Creatives, Enrich Lives"Narrative:"Creativity is more than a pursuit—it’s a vital force. For many, it’s a deep need that, when stifled, dims both their spirit and the world they touch. Business and finance play a critical role in turning creative work into reality, but for creatives, navigating these areas can feel like a complex maze. Managing multiple tools for creation, distribution, and monetization often pulls them away from their craft. Distributed Creatives steps in to change that. We offer a single, streamlined platform where creatives can focus on what drives them—creating—while we take care of the rest. By simplifying the practical side of art, we free creatives to thrive on their terms, creating a wave of value that lifts audiences, industries, and communities alike. With Distributed Creatives, we’re not just building a tool; we’re nurturing a movement that honors and sustains creativity."
