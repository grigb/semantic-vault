    **Specification & Scope Document: Puck Integration with WordPress**
    
    ## **Objective**
    
    The goal is to create a modular and extensible system that allows for deep integration between **Puck Editor** and **WordPress**, with dynamic support for PeepSo, third-party plugins, REST API calls, shortcodes, Gutenberg blocks, and user-specific content. While the core implementation focuses on React with Puck, additional integration considerations are outlined for potential future expansion.
    
    To ensure development efficiency, **a structured approach to testing is required**, documenting all test cases in a way that prevents steps from being lost, while maintaining a streamlined workflow. The system should generate necessary documentation automatically, without overburdening the process.
