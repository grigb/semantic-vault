# Notes on personal profiles

I went through every feature on the profile when I signed up for Dank PHART and this is a list of everything I came across that I think could looked at more closely for tweaking

- email to activate account went to spam
- gender choice is only male/female, not sure exactly what other options we want
- billing address doesn’t seem to save when updated
- video posts aren’t native only can be shared via a link in the post, I’m guessing this is because of hosting videos takes a ton of bandwidth so probably not something we can change yet
- events on the profile opens up and there’s no profile navigation bar have to click back on web browser to continue using other features
