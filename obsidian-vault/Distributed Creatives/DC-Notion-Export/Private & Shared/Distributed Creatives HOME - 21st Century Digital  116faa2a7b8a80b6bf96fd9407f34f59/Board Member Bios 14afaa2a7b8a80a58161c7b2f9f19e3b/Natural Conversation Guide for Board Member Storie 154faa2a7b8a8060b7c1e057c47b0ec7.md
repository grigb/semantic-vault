# Natural Conversation Guide for Board Member Stories

## Opening the Conversation

Start with something casual like:
"I'd love to hear your story - and I mean the whole story, not just the professional highlights. What got you started on this path?"

## Key Areas to Explore (Naturally)

Let the conversation flow, but keep these themes in mind to weave in:

### Their Creative Soul

- Listen for mentions of art, music, or creative interests
- If they mention a creative pursuit, dig deeper: "Tell me more about that..."
- Watch for moments when their eyes light up talking about past creative endeavors

### Life Journey Threads

- When they mention an interesting experience: "How did that shape your perspective?"
- If they talk about professional work: "What were you dreaming of doing before that?"
- For surprising revelations: "I had no idea! What other hidden talents are you hiding?"

### Grant & Professional Experience

Rather than asking directly, listen for natural openings:

- If they mention a project: "How did you handle the funding for that?"
- When discussing past work: "What kind of impact did that have?"
- On community mentions: "How did you keep everyone aligned toward the goals?"

### Vision & Passion

Look for moments to ask:

- "Where do you see all this heading?"
- "What gets you excited about the future of creativity?"
- "How do you think your experience could help transform things?"

## Natural Follow-ups

Some ways to dig deeper:

- "That's fascinating - what happened next?"
- "How did that experience change your approach?"
- "What surprised you most about that?"
- "Looking back, what would you do differently?"

## Key Information to Listen For

While keeping it conversational, track:

- Grant amounts and management experience (when mentioned naturally)
- Technical projects and implementations
- Community building successes
- Cross-discipline collaborations
- Unique skill combinations
- Networks and connections
- Creative background and aspirations

## Remember

- Let them do most of the talking
- Follow their energy - when they get animated, go deeper
- Connect threads between different parts of their story
- Draw out specific examples through natural curiosity
- Let stories emerge organically rather than forcing them

## If The Conversation Gets Stuck

Return to curiosity:

- "What was that journey like?"
- "Tell me about a time when..."
- "What led you to that decision?"
- "How has that influenced your current work?"
- "What would surprise people about your background?"

## Wrapping Up

Look for a natural moment to ask:
"Given everything you've shared, what makes you most excited about being part of this project?"

End Note: The goal is to gather the same information as a formal interview, but through genuine curiosity and conversation. Let their stories lead while gently steering toward the important areas.
