00:00:00:00 - 00:00:23:02
Unknown
Hello? Can you hear me?

00:00:23:04 - 00:00:48:23
Unknown
I can hear you. When you said. All right, here we go. Back in the seat now. Hello? Hello. How are you? This meeting is being recorded. I know, yes. Are you going to use it for, What is it? Video production purposes meeting. Is anyone else going to see this twice? Meeting you? No, no, but I am recording it.

00:00:49:15 - 00:01:14:02
Unknown
The just the method here. Recording the interview. Hopefully we can do that about an hour. We're good. And then I'm going to shoot guns after I talk to you. Happy to go longer. The more detail we collect, the more complete the bio will be for you and wherever. And so we can use it on distributed creatives or anywhere else that you might want to use it.

00:01:14:11 - 00:01:38:21
Unknown
So with that in mind, please cover the things you want to see in the bio. And yeah, this is, I won't be sharing the video with anyone. I'm just going to transcribe it and then run it through an eye to, like, summarize stuff and, and like, kind of, you know, tweak a, a bio into its final form, which I'll then share with you for approval before anyone else sees it.

00:01:38:23 - 00:02:08:15
Unknown
Okay. I guess I was asking more for the fact if it was being recorded, for something else. Because I'm going to eat. 000, yeah. Yeah. No worries. Yeah, yeah. That that that's more of what I was concerned about. I also should probably pull up my, resume, but I have stuff in my head. It's just that this is right now I have a memory issue with the, you know, the test that's on suppression.

00:02:08:17 - 00:02:51:19
Unknown
So I should be able to remember stuff. But there might be some things that might not be issues with. But, I can tell you, you know, websites that you go to pure information. Sure. And if you have, a resume that would help fill in the gaps because, then I won't have to ask you, like. And I wouldn't expect you to remember, you know, dates and company names and all that kind of stuff, but, that would really help because ideally, you know, the, the, the bios for us getting grants and, they want, they'll want to see quantifiable stuff and, like, you know, I'm not really sure how that's going to

00:02:51:19 - 00:03:22:07
Unknown
end up because nobody wants to read too much. But I was going to create like a, a comprehensive set of documents and then be able to generate bios based on what grants were applying for. So that sounds good. I got that I did essentially onboarding into Gmail while we talked about okay. And seeing where the last CD that I sent, to.

00:03:22:09 - 00:03:53:01
Unknown
Search. Okay. So 17 2123 yeah. That's okay. So November 19th. So I am having kind of an audio problem. I just want to get it as clear as possible for the. Oh, that's probably better. So much. I think I was listening to the reflection off the back wall just out of my head. Yeah, probably.

00:03:53:03 - 00:04:20:17
Unknown
Yeah. So I'm. What I'm doing right now is I'm going through email, just looking to see when the last time I sent this one from 731. Because I don't have my computers right now. Yeah. So that's the is, but I should in the next couple of days, but still. So here's one from 731. See CV 723 was when it was edited.

00:04:21:05 - 00:04:49:17
Unknown
Let me forward that to you. Okay. And yeah, if I, if I had had that ahead of time, I would have been able to. Yeah. Sorry about slightly different interview, but I think it'll go well. Yeah. And, include attachments to create your, distributed, distributed creatives. That one, that one work. Yep. Okay. And I'm just rare.

00:04:49:17 - 00:05:18:00
Unknown
I'm not seeing any I'm not writing anything. Okay. So you should get that should be a CV, which is like a professional CV that was edited up to 20th July of 2023, which was last year. Okay. And of course, that would mean that none of this stuff that like, you know, being a board member, for distributed creatives and some of the other stuff I'm doing with, oh.

00:05:18:00 - 00:05:47:11
Unknown
Jesus. Relax, Brian. The other network. Hold on. See, this is where. See what? I try the problem is, is not is. It's when I try to think of something, it creates, a fuzz. It's really strange, but if I'm not thinking of it, just talking, it will come out. And of course, my phone can't. I can't miss it anyway.

00:05:47:11 - 00:06:14:09
Unknown
And that that the work that I'm doing with them will also not be in this resume. And bloom, that's your bloom network. Oh, okay. That's that's the other because I'm working with them as well. So should be Creatives in Bloom that work information will not be on that resum√©, but we can add that and talk about it when you when you're ready.

00:06:14:11 - 00:06:41:13
Unknown
Great. Yeah. And no worries if you can't remember stuff. We we can circle back and fill in the gaps, like, you know, asynchronously through email or whatever. Yeah. And yeah, look out for that email. I'm not going to try to read your resume right now. Oh, to it now. Yeah. But, hopefully, you don't end up with hiccups because you're going to need to do most of the talking.

00:06:41:13 - 00:07:10:14
Unknown
And while you're eating there, okay. But, you should see what happens. Yeah, yeah. So, yeah, thanks for the time today. Appreciate that. Really interested in learning the whole story. Both the formal background and the grass works that you do. Grass root works. Forget gathering the information for both to get to know you better and to strengthen our grant applications.

00:07:11:07 - 00:07:17:08
Unknown
And before we dive in, do you have any questions for me?

00:07:17:10 - 00:07:48:04
Unknown
No, no. Okay. Cool. Yeah. That's good. So, yeah, I've kind of figured out how long each section here will take. I'll just let you know I'm covering academic and research, organizations and initiatives, music and cultural events, community building and support, cross-cultural connections and global impact, and your vision and strategic direction. So those are the the main subjects.

00:07:48:16 - 00:08:05:21
Unknown
Okay. An idea. Wow. Those are broad. I know, I know, those are the headings. I'm going to try to get into the details here. And I've just kind of figured out like, how much time we need for each section to keep it in. And hour. So going to keep track for time and. Yeah. All right.

00:08:06:00 - 00:09:01:24
Unknown
So, I'd love to start off by understanding your academic journey and research background. Do you want to kind of give me some info on that? Yeah. I started my, academic journey in, we'll say, graduating from high school and Overbrook High School, in Philadelphia, which was a magnet school. So I was, a kind of one of the student pioneers in developing or being involved in and helping to develop, a model which was the magnet model in which they, like, electronic engineering sciences is like one magnet and then like mathematics and art, was another magnet, you could call it section or, for

00:09:01:24 - 00:09:39:07
Unknown
lack of better terms. I don't know, it's sector of, of education in the high school situation. And they had divided it into a couple of, different sectors. And, I was, involved in like three of those sectors at the same time. So, math and engineering, which I think has become now, smote science, math something and and technology, it's, it's, you know, manifested into that or moved into that.

00:09:39:09 - 00:10:14:14
Unknown
And I also was in the arts magnet arts and music magnet at the same time. So which was a concentration of, you know, high school education on the arts and, not just arts of like, performance arts, but it was also like, business and administrative kind of arts. So, and from that, I moved into my undergraduate career at Temple University, and I, and I took that into, Temple University, trying to merge the two.

00:10:14:23 - 00:10:49:11
Unknown
And I started out in production, kind of, of radio, television and film, technological production. And that was my kind of major in the beginning, along with art at the same time. And so I went to the Tyler School of Art. I was a student at the Tyler School of Art, which is a the art school for Temple University, while at the same time being in the communications school, which is what radio, television and film was under in media school.

00:10:49:13 - 00:11:23:13
Unknown
And the name of the school is Escaping me and no Annenberg. There we go, Annenberg School of Communications. So I got my undergraduate from those two schools, Annenberg School Communications and, Tyler School of Art. And I ended up, just finishing with, kind of performing arts degree with a minor in the communications. But while I was, part of undergraduate, I was very involved in and, student and, campus life.

00:11:23:13 - 00:11:49:05
Unknown
So, I, I was also started out as an athlete and was running in track and, and then, as athletics became a little bit burdensome, at that time. And it's even become more burdensome for some people, as a student, because it's almost like the NCAA owns you. You know, people, I was like, I can't, I can't do this.

00:11:49:05 - 00:12:27:15
Unknown
So I kind of fell out of athletics and just became more involved in like, representing the school in for athletics in as a leader and, and doing some other things, in student activities and student life. Resource. So like and that's where I get involved with like student government and, and things like that. Right. And so that led me to, oh, well, I want to be involved in kind of counseling and connecting people and helping to, develop relationships with people both in business and in, in life and helping people to deal with their issues.

00:12:27:15 - 00:13:01:06
Unknown
And that's where I left and went into, counseling in my master's. So my master's was counseling psych, but at the same time, I had, at the University of North Carolina, I had been given first, at Winthrop College before I moved to University of North Carolina and assistantship in athletics. Right. In order for me to basically do my master's in counseling, I accept an assistantship because I wasn't a rich kid.

00:13:01:06 - 00:13:28:20
Unknown
So, you know, that was a way of me getting into a master's program. And so I was the assistant athletic director at Winthrop College, which is, a small college in Rock Hill, South Carolina. And my job was to, be the coach of the yell leaders and cheerleaders there. But at the same time, I was overall assistant athletic director.

00:13:28:20 - 00:13:59:01
Unknown
That was for, like, academic, development for the athletes, period. Does that make sense? So, that really helped me to get a sense of what students need to be successful academic success and and work, you know, and how to help them develop their balance, their, athletic, athletics, along with their academic development at the same time.

00:13:59:01 - 00:14:36:21
Unknown
So that was that's really big part of my, of my model that I still hold today in terms of academics. Right, is that there's extracurriculars, there's curricular, and they, should be helping each other and not, hurting each other. Right. And so from there, I moved to North Carolina, Charlotte, which is where I ended up, getting my master's in counseling psych from, and, instead of being an athletic director, I gave up the athletic director job.

00:14:36:21 - 00:15:06:03
Unknown
Associate athletic director to be a live in counselor at, my my fraternities house in at that campus, right. So I became a living, academic counselor, which is interesting because, it was the South, and, being a person of color, it was, very challenging in the beginning for, for them. And, you know, I took it with a grain of salt and went crazy.

00:15:06:03 - 00:15:53:08
Unknown
I can tell you some stories about some fun things that they've done that they did when I first got there. But, we won't bug you down. But needless to say that, over the course of 2 to 3 years, helped develop, you know, me individually, as with a particular identity, shift, being an inner city person of color to a very rural, you know, white, space and to being to working, to being accepted and working to help them individually with their issues as well as, with those structural issues like race and all those other kind of things.

00:15:53:10 - 00:16:20:06
Unknown
So that became, a big part of my life, right? That structural, stuff. And so I decided to get my PhD in what we call structure and personality, which is the psychological interplay between individuals and their identities and their behaviors relative to structures that they all deal with. And those structures are just business structures, but they're social structures of all kinds.

00:16:20:06 - 00:16:47:21
Unknown
So business, you know, family, friends, you know, political. Right? All those are structural things that people are interacting with when they are developing their personality. And it's the kind of interplay between those. So a personality develops based on the structure when and, our personalities helped to develop the structure that were in.

00:16:48:01 - 00:17:26:17
Unknown
Right. And so that's what I ended up with. My PhD is, a social psychologist that is focused on structure and personality. So that's my academic place. Where did I what did I do with that in terms of research? A big part of the research, was in my both my master's and my, PhD, I received a, a fellowship, which he a fellow at the Munich h e and I'm, I'm blanking on what it means, but you can look it up.

00:17:26:19 - 00:17:55:21
Unknown
I is something of higher education. The e is center for Higher Education. Western something. Coalition or something. Commission of higher education. And that went towards my master's, research which helped me to, to, to do that. And, my master's research was in looked at framing and how people frame, things like race and frame things like religion.

00:17:55:23 - 00:18:23:15
Unknown
Right. And create frames in society, to help people understand their ideologies. So that's what framing is all about. So if I frame something as, a good and beneficial, then you're more likely to accept that ideology than if I frame it as, I don't like you or you, you know, it's you are a bad B, right?

00:18:23:15 - 00:19:03:11
Unknown
Or you need this because you don't have what it takes. And it's it's something that's also used in sales and manipulation of, of human. So that's what I did. My, my research, in my master's program relative to, I also received a fellowship in my, PhD program, which was a dissertation fellow ship. And, again, well, it's probably on my resume what the dissertation fellowship was from, because I can't remember offhand, but, and that was used to do my first, set of research as a PhD that I never published from.

00:19:03:11 - 00:19:38:19
Unknown
I did the paper, but I did not publish that paper, even though, I probably could have but it was, looking at, identify self-identification on the intersection of social spirituality and religion. So the intersection would produce four different types of, ideology spiritual and religious, spiritual and not religious, not spiritual and religious and not spiritual and not religious.

00:19:38:19 - 00:20:09:20
Unknown
Right. And looked at how that outcome, ideological outcome was related to the different structural factors in a given country. And I looked at 33 different countries. So if the country was like religious, religion and state intertwined versus separation of religion and state, right. Looked at what kind of political experience was it Democratic? Or was it, you know, autocratic and.

00:20:09:20 - 00:20:38:00
Unknown
Right, looked at different things and said, what kind of identity emerges and where? And that's what that, research did. So I think that gives you a sense of my research and academic intertwining, and we can talk about research and stuff after that, if you want to later. Yeah. Excellent. Thank you. You you answered a whole bunch of the questions I had for you.

00:20:38:01 - 00:21:10:06
Unknown
Like you like a pro. If. Yeah. So a couple of things. Just curious how that your academic background has influenced what you're doing now, and, how you, And. Yeah, let's start with that. The other thing is really, just wondering if you've managed any research grants or funding, because I just wanted to cover, like, that side of things as well, your professional experience with researching.

00:21:10:08 - 00:21:43:00
Unknown
Okay. So let's let's go. Let's do that first. So right after I graduate my PhD, I became the associate dean at the University of Colorado and at the University of Colorado and School of Engineering. I was the associate dean for, minority retention and student retention, rather, and minority engineering program. So, and that position was grant funded?

00:21:43:12 - 00:22:10:01
Unknown
It was partially grant funded and it was the program. Excuse me. It was partially grant funded. And, and some of it was state funded. Right. So that means that my job was basically to bring in the grants from that program, for that program that was used for that program. So the soft money, the, the, the, the larger percentage of moneys that was used to run that program was soft money that we bring in from grants.

00:22:10:05 - 00:22:37:02
Unknown
So starting day one, in my first job from my PhD, I was, responsible for bringing in grants to a major program. And, I mean, there's I can't even tell you the numbers of, grants total. But, you know, we're looking at, like, you know, millions of dollars and thousands of dollars grants that we had to bring in.

00:22:37:17 - 00:23:06:01
Unknown
Many of them were already, was it like, called? They were already sponsors for programs, through the engineering, school. And the engineering school had a list of donors and a list of sponsors, a company sponsors. So some of those sponsors that were like Ball Aerospace because Colorado is a big aerospace, situation.

00:23:06:15 - 00:23:37:24
Unknown
And, and cause and you know, so the, the amount of the levels of companies that I dealt with were those large corporations, that we have, I've, and I was in that position and then also another position at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, which also was, student success grant oriented. And our goal was and our one of a part of our job was to bring in, bring in grants.

00:23:39:21 - 00:24:19:22
Unknown
I have, been involved also as the, as the, when I was talking about the work at South Carolina in my master's program, I was also, pulling in grants and working with grants as the counseling, as a part of my counseling program. I was started as an intern at the, alcohol and drug education program, and my boss, retired or left, I forget, she left, and I ended up becoming the interim director.

00:24:19:24 - 00:24:58:15
Unknown
So there I was also, pulling in grants because, a big part of the alcohol in education program is providing soft money for therapies and all those other kind of things and, and group programs for, for students and, students and, and community members alike. So, since moving out of the Dean's position and going back into, you know, when I went and got my, PhD because I started as a dean and went back and got the PhD in Arizona.

00:24:58:17 - 00:25:26:08
Unknown
I was working with also programs in Arizona as a graduate student that were developing, and working with artists because I became a part of the Burning Man community. So artist was really important and a big part of that is getting grants. So art grants and with, the I've gotten several Burning Man art grants, to develop installations and, a lot of those art.

00:25:26:10 - 00:25:54:00
Unknown
So we're also community art grants. Small art grants is not maybe, you know, millions of dollars, but small grants here and there, work and helping people to get small grants for their artwork. And now that has moved me into my position of going back into that world as an executive director of my own foundation and, nonprofit.

00:25:54:00 - 00:26:22:19
Unknown
Right. To support and to develop those causes by, working with people to get grants and to donate, you know, individual donations and grants from foundations and things like that. Other, and governmental grants to help with causes like the continuation of arts, which is one of the causes that the foundation, in military of life along with you all see, is all about.

00:26:22:21 - 00:26:57:21
Unknown
So, everything that I've done in those institutions to help develop soft money is now rolled into what I'm doing, in my own foundation, in my work to help develop soft money for the causes rather than develop soft money for an institution. Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Excellent. So. So it sounds like, you you've had some success with that, and I'm wondering, I did want to get into that at some point.

00:26:58:12 - 00:27:22:16
Unknown
Maybe now's the right time for that. But just what you're doing with your foundation, and the various entities and, I know when we talked at one point, you were looking for members to help you, with all of these initiatives. And, I'm actually personally interested in doing that with you. And and you know, giving back in the ways you've been giving to distributed creatives.

00:27:22:16 - 00:27:40:05
Unknown
I really appreciate it. And I think, you know, if you need my help, I'd be happy to, lend some time to that. But, if you have some stuff that you'd like to cover or talk about, I, I have a vague understanding from the list. Bullet list that you gave me of the things that you're working on.

00:27:40:05 - 00:28:00:06
Unknown
But, what are your what are you really passionate about and what seem like some of them were, you know, supporting, people who have, you know, medical needs. And then there was, like, some outreach for arts and. Yeah, if you, if you if I'd love it if you could elaborate on that a little bit.

00:28:00:06 - 00:28:32:14
Unknown
Yeah. So, I mean, some people will try to say, that when they do stuff like this, that. Oh, no, it's not personal. Has nothing. You know, I'm, I'm I'm being altruistic, but, I believe that all altruism is connected to personal experience, so, Yes, there are five different causes that I that are dear to me and that are not just dear to me, but they are personal to me because I've been personally involved in them.

00:28:32:16 - 00:29:04:14
Unknown
And so the passion that I have in helping with these causes are related specifically to me to, to some extent, you know, I have, was diagnosed with, prostate cancer. About four years ago and, and still in my, in my last year of treatment of prostate cancer right now. So, and during that time, treatments, I had to do radiation.

00:29:04:18 - 00:29:43:17
Unknown
And lucky I was lucky enough that I had to direct to radiation. And just a follow up testosterone suppression treatment. But there are people who are have to do, chemotherapy, and other treatments that are more invasive than, than my treatment, but, and so even with my treatment, I had to do, 38 straight days of radiation and, 38 straight days of radiation are not 38 like in a row, but 38 week days.

00:29:43:19 - 00:30:06:12
Unknown
And that means the weekends. I didn't have to do them, but 38 straight days, it's like a month and a half to two months. And if you mess up or if you don't prepare like you have to do, preparing for your body and every treatment to cancer treatment has to have some kind of preparation. So people can't eat this or they can't do, you know, they have to, to drink this amount of water and they have to like, I had to drink four quarts of water, like, before.

00:30:06:12 - 00:30:46:23
Unknown
I could have my treatment. Which, you know, for me, that was like, what? I would, you know, probably drink a quart a day, which is probably. And it's it's a problem because I should be drinking course water. But anyway, so, and that and, you know, you couldn't transport yourself, because the treatments caused you to be weak or conscious to be disoriented and, and people who are taking chemotherapy, it is basically, blood transfusions, chemotherapy, there's some pills, but, people taking blood tubes, they, they get their blood drawn from them, which makes them really, weak and not have the ability to do things.

00:30:46:23 - 00:31:13:05
Unknown
And so, they're tired all the time. And so in terms of, like, people lose their jobs, people can't continue to support themselves. They it becomes tax to support, becomes taxing on their families because they have to, you know, ask for rides, they have to, you know, they, they, they, they, they, they start losing income.

00:31:13:05 - 00:31:44:22
Unknown
So they of course, have to have resources in that, that, that becomes taxing on people, their families. And, their economic suppliers or economic sources, shall we say. Right. And that happened to me. And like, I just, you know, luckily I was in a situation that I was able to get, being, to my job was teaching and, being contract teachers, at colleges.

00:31:44:22 - 00:32:27:24
Unknown
I could just not accept a contract right when my treatment came up. And then go on to, unemployment while that was the case. Right. You know, but that's not that's not the case for a lot of other people who are dealing with, you know, their cancer treatments. And so that first cause, the is is just that it's it's, we started a charitable fund at USC Denver to assist people who are, dealing with the effects of treatment, economic effects of treatment, and being involved with that.

00:32:27:24 - 00:33:04:23
Unknown
So, and that is clearly, directed or started or a part of my passion or I'm passionate about because of my experience and knowing what the how that I experience is relative to other people's experiences are way greater and way, more problematic than I am having people have to, like, clear out their bank accounts and all kinds of things, savings, people having no savings, at all and being billed millions and, you know, of dollars from the health care system, which of course, people are right now being very, very vocal about in our society.

00:33:05:00 - 00:33:40:02
Unknown
Similarly, the second cause, the sickle cell anemia is research is, a disease that affects people of color, particularly African-Americans, United States, pretty, pretty harshly. And, unfortunately, that has not been a priority, to research in the medical field. You know, we won't we won't go into speculate, you know, the the, racial disparity, reasons for racial disparity.

00:33:40:02 - 00:34:20:00
Unknown
But we can just say it's it's you know, it's a, clearly a disparity in the research that is focused on diseases that affect people of color more than people of, you know, majority status or, higher economic status in our country. And, that is particularly unfair and problematic, causing people, you know, to lose their lives because we are not putting enough, resources into finding out ways to help, you know, save and to help, people who are dealing with this disease.

00:34:20:02 - 00:34:50:02

And my niece, Nikki. And that's what this fund is named after. She herself, died of sickle cell anemia, complications. And, we have seen that in the past ten years, since her death. Things that shifted and there's been, a lot more work, but there's definitely more work that is needed. And again, the priority of resources is not there in our NIH and all these other places.

00:34:50:02 - 00:35:18:21
Unknown
But we need, you know, people to lobby, for, for this and especially as, regimes, we won't call them regimes. Administrations change, you know, political administrations change. And, you know, funding from NIH and other places are going to be in jeopardy for multiple things. So and so that's really important again, personally and overall. Right.

00:35:19:08 - 00:35:42:00
Unknown
The arts, which of course, I've kind of talked about already, working in and being a part of, in growing up in and is constantly being looked at, in our society political system saying, the arts, does it need to be funded? We need to cut funding from here. We need to, you know, the arts is the last to be funded.

00:35:43:14 - 00:36:14:01
Unknown
In many spaces. And that's the first to be cut. Programs would be cut. So, and we in the arts are a really big part of, in terms of counseling and having, being a part of that, that realm of mental health. The arts are a large, very big part, you know, and keeping people mentally stable, mentally sound, being able to be mindful, directing, hearing different types of music and, expressing themselves in different types of art.

00:36:14:03 - 00:36:39:08
Unknown
Our it's really, really, really, really important. And I and has the arts is continuously defunded attacked. We need to have sources that can help not, you know, not just take up the slack because I don't think we should just take up slack. We need to say no, we're not going to take up the slack. We are going to force our society to maintain and make sure that the arts are continued right in and sourced the way they should be.

00:36:39:18 - 00:37:18:19
Unknown
So there you have three. So we have two more causes, right? Which are, alternative educational programs because, you know, being in education and having been in education and you can say, I'm retiring from education to go into the private sector to, to to be a executive director of a foundation. The system has definitely changed and moved from being an institution that committed to actually, building an educational database or building informational database in humans that are necessary to thrive in the particular social systems.

00:37:19:05 - 00:37:49:16
Unknown
That is not the case anymore. It is like it's an institution that is is working to maintain itself and its mission or its ideology is is secondary to that. And so we need to to keep our eyes on the prize and think education is important. What do we need to educate our children, our youth and how what what is important for them to have in their minds in order to be critical thinkers and to be able to to sustain particular situations, in particular social structures.

00:37:49:16 - 00:38:19:05
Unknown
Right. And and we have to do that through alternative means, because, the institution is not doing that anymore. And, yeah, we can't afford to not have our children be educated with what they need to survive. And so that's where the continuation of arts is important to me. And then the last thing is that mobility, social mobility and getting people to be able to help people.

00:38:19:05 - 00:38:51:15
Unknown
So, you know, right now we have the, the what is is that the department of what is it, Doge or whatever, coming in with this administration, the Department of Government Efficiency and government efficiency is scary. Yeah. Is scary. Which is saying, oh, so we got a slimmed down government. And what does that mean? It means social programs are going to be targeted to have less and less and less, while there's homeless people growing more and more and more, and housing is getting out of hand.

00:38:51:17 - 00:39:21:18
Unknown
So people can't, you know, purchase houses anymore or invest in, land anymore because it's too difficult for them to, to gain access to. And that is affecting the social mobility of human beings. And we need to be able, you know, in a what's supposedly a democratically free which society. That's should be something that is supposedly a part of our, you know, liberty and, what is it?

00:39:21:24 - 00:39:48:20
Unknown
Our Constitution says liberty and, I'm blanking, but, you know, the the what? Our Constitution kind of guarantees to rights. Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Thank you. And the pursuit of happiness. The the effects of our pursuit of happiness is is is being, affected by this upward this problem, difficulty in being socially upward, mobile and mobile, really?

00:39:48:22 - 00:40:13:23
Unknown
When you say mobility, you're saying, the ability to rise up or rise through the social constructs and become a person that you want to be? Yes. Yeah. And get the benefits from the social system and, help assistance from the social system to get you to, to be where you want to be as a human being. And you have the right to be, because that's a right as a citizen of the United States.

00:40:14:00 - 00:40:53:11
Unknown
So so those are. Yeah, those are the five causes. Then you can see how those are connected to to everything else that I've done. And I've just put them into programs now. And the goal is to take those causes and to develop funds from different donors and different, different, sources to try to develop, funds that can help people and we can use to, to to maintain those courses and to, have that and not maintain the causes, but have an effect on the outcomes related to those causes.

00:40:53:13 - 00:41:17:16
Unknown
So that's the goal. Wonderfully said. Very emotional. I feel, moved by all that. I, I can see you've you've identified what you think are the issues and you've just plowed straight ahead with solutions. And you're it's it's quite inspiring and, you know, getting tingles just thinking about it. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you. That's really cool.

00:41:18:12 - 00:41:42:20
Unknown
And and I think, yeah, the, I think you've talked a little bit about organizations and initiatives that you've been developing, and that was kind of like the whole change that I wanted to talk about. And you've kind of covered most of that. Okay. I think, yeah. In terms of making that like, complete, this stuff might be a little bit dry and I've heard a little bit of this before already.

00:41:42:21 - 00:42:12:24
Unknown
Okay. I'm just wondering, like, out of all of these efforts, what what models have you developed for funding? And, approaches to building an organization and balancing that, formal and informal support structures? You know, like what what sort of experiences have you had there with, like, the legal and the regulatory and just the, you know, that's in bolts of getting this stuff done?

00:42:13:01 - 00:42:53:22
Unknown
Well, I mean, I try to stay away from as much of legal possible and regular, but sure. But we have to be we have to be aware of the structure that exist. And, and I think that's really, really important. So knowing you know currently this is the structure. There's you know, there are regulatory agencies that are set up by the governmental administrations and those regulatory agencies look at what our behaviors are as both individuals and, business entities.

00:42:53:22 - 00:43:34:18
Unknown
Right. And then they provide incentives, both financial and social incentives. In terms of capital capitals, we would call them because there's financial is capital, but there's also social capital and there's other kinds of capital. Right. And understanding the relationships between what we are trying to do, our ideologies and our goals with what the government has, the system, has set up, I think is really, really important.

00:43:34:20 - 00:44:12:00
Unknown
And by examining those things, we can say, okay, this is what's going to be beneficial for us as an organization that's attempting to, you know, gain these things or attempting to meet these scores or objectives. And so, you know, in terms of business structures, I it's very important to understand the interplay between for profit and not for profit, entities and what the government does to each one of those.

00:44:12:00 - 00:44:46:11
Unknown
Right. Think in terms of, to make it, to try to make it really dry and dirty, to what is it dirty and down to dirt. Dirt or whatever, earthy, down to whatever the term is, cut and dry, dirty and dry, whatever, down to earth and cut dry. Is that a for profit? The government is going to try to get as much from you in your producing of your products, providing of your services as possible.

00:44:46:13 - 00:45:20:08
Unknown
Individually, they're going to come after you to get less of that, but they're still trying to gain resources from your, production, product production and your services because their model, government model is that, we have to get our resources from the people to serve the people. Right? That's kind of what the government or any government's model is in some, minimalistic way.

00:45:21:00 - 00:45:58:18
Unknown
The for profits are basically looked at by government as, individual and public entities, that are from that are, that are performed by the actual people or the citizenry to do some of the stuff that the government is saying it's is doing for the people. So in essence, now, unlike a contractor, the not for profits are somewhat there are organizations that are non-governmental organizations or NGOs.

00:45:58:18 - 00:46:31:05
Unknown
You can say, right, that are actually performing to do the things that they that the government says it's going to do. The government says, oh, we will feed the hungry. And so we only have a certain amount of governmental possibility to do that. And there's these other organizations that can actually help us do that. And so because you are helping us do that, we're going to give you less scrutiny, or are we going to come for less of your resources?

00:46:31:07 - 00:46:55:13
Unknown
Than if you were a, for profit? That's not doing that for us, but is only doing it for themselves, right? Right. Hey, you're saying that's that's your from all of this is kind of like, oh, there's a strategy here of what kind of entity to be and how to approach getting funding and yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:46:55:13 - 00:47:36:10
Unknown
It's, it's the is to know who what I'm, what I'm saying is to know what the government sees us as. Right. So it either sees us as, a set of the population that is gaining it, resources from the population and not doing something for the population in, in terms of, in terms of its focus, while the nonprofit sector is actually doing stuff for the population that the government wants, needs to be done.

00:47:36:12 - 00:47:58:22
Unknown
Right. So we it treats them differently and says, these people over here, that are for profit, we're going to try to take as much as possible because they're getting stuff and they're not giving it the beginning. It's all focused on them, getting them, you know, building their wealth. Well, these groups over here are actually using their resources to help, the population in general.

00:47:58:24 - 00:48:17:01
Unknown
And they treat them differently. Right. And so that in itself says, well, then, then how do we want to operate? What do we want to operate when we are thinking about operating? Do we want to operate as a nonprofit? I mean, for profit, because we know that the government is going to come and try to get as much as possible for us, or and that's okay.

00:48:17:01 - 00:48:38:00
Unknown
Some of us, for profit people will say, cool, we understand that. And so we want to make as much profit as possible so we can give the government as much money as possible so that we can help, the people, you know, in the long run. So that's the kind of trickle down theory, right? Or some of the, for profit corporations say, no, no, I don't really trust that.

00:48:40:08 - 00:48:57:12
Unknown
And I'm not in some of the for profit. I don't care less about the general population. I just want to to, build my product and get as much make as much, you know, capital, get as much, gain as much capital for the people who are producing my product, me, my, my employees and blah, blah, blah.

00:48:57:12 - 00:49:24:10
Unknown
Right. And those are those are absolutely fine ideologies. But there is are both different for profit ideologies. Right. And then there's nonprofits, the people who are doing nonprofits, their ideologies are okay, we are here to provide a service and, to provide something that needs to be provided. And, that is about providing for all of our constituents that are out there.

00:49:24:12 - 00:49:52:00
Unknown
Or it could be providing for our set of people that are involved or our memberships or our, you know, our set of people like a church, might be both. A church might be more about, saying, okay, we are doing this, providing this service, to, to help the people who are our members, but at the same time, to help the people who are families or our members or people who are in our community and, doing that.

00:49:52:00 - 00:50:21:11
Unknown
And so that's, again, ideologies within that set of entities that are different, that are looked at by the government differently. Right? Yeah. So that's why that's why the the sense, what's important, what I'm saying is important is to know what the, how the government sees and how your organization fits into what the government sees you as in order to decide operationally how you should operate.

00:50:21:13 - 00:50:43:06
Unknown
And yeah, there to to yeah. What I was try to lead into and I just didn't want to I don't spend too much time on it because there's a few other things I'm just fascinated about that. I want to ask you, but for the sake of the bio, well, what I really want to frame all of this in a way where it says, well, these are the things that you've done.

00:50:44:11 - 00:51:16:00
Unknown
After learning about the structures, that have been successful and, you know, programs that have come out of it through, working on that, I think we've covered most of that. But if there's anything, around that, let's just say that the process that I took from that once I discovered what the the government was looking at in terms of government, in terms of organizations, I decided, this is what my ideology or this is what my goal is.

00:51:16:02 - 00:52:04:00
Unknown
All right. In order to get to that goal. And that goal was, to that is that was is to restructure, structure, society or communities that I'm in and which eventually would create a larger society to, a closed economic system, meaning capitalism or the larger structure that we talked about, about how the government looks at those entities is about extracting from the entities right for profit, extracting the resources that they game nonprofit, extracting the services that they provide.

00:52:04:02 - 00:52:39:08
Unknown
Right. That's the government's extraction of the two different types of entities. And I said, okay, the problem with our society is that extraction is it's constantly pulling from our communities, and our communities are not able to maintain the resources it needs. Right. Which by design, that's by design, because there would be no reason for the government to have to extract.

00:52:39:10 - 00:53:07:08
Unknown
Right? Because it's extracting in order to provide what you don't have. Right. So if your community ended up having the resources it needs, then there would be no reason for extraction and hence no reason for a government. Right? So yeah, what you're saying is kind of like, make it building sustainable systems that don't require intervention because they're broken.

00:53:07:10 - 00:53:36:24
Unknown
That's correct. So if we had a sustainable system, we would not need a government to provide us the stuff that we need to get because we can't sustain it. Right. We would, government role would be different. It would be either regulatory to make sure that we regulate ourselves. Right. Or it might be, maintenance, like, would you call it like, like the electric company, is it utility?

00:53:36:24 - 00:54:21:04
Unknown
That's it. Maintenance and utility. Right. So, you know, it'd be nice if they were just worried about that stuff. Yeah. There we go. All right. So, so that being the the the the case, I was like, what can I, what can we use in the system and to do get to the place that we want to get which would be a closed system, meaning that resources are coming in and only going out in order to bring in, like only going out in order to bring in and then minimizing what goes out right and regulating what goes out in order to bring in right and building our resource base with what's coming in, storing, storing,

00:54:21:04 - 00:54:46:22
Unknown
storage. Kind of like we used to do in tribes, right? Going back to a sense of tribe, my tribe needs this. The winter is coming. We, you know, build and and and plant. And then we take a certain amount and we store and we use a certain amount for dinners and for meals for the. Then we're talking food here, great meals for this, level.

00:54:46:22 - 00:55:15:03
Unknown
And we don't overeat. We don't overindulge because we need to maintain a certain amount, for a certain level of situation that might occur. And that is, again, back to tribal ness. And so we looking at the two systems, we can use that basically, or looking at the two entities that are within that system. We talked about the for profit non profit and the government.

00:55:15:05 - 00:55:44:13
Unknown
Right. We can say, oh we can use the for profit to generate resources, right. To bring into the group. Right. And to actually take to be the, the, the, the what's the avenue to actually provide services to take, you know, go out of the group. But again, where we, we decide what is leads the group through that for profit system.

00:55:44:16 - 00:56:26:01
Unknown
Right. What resources are used. And then we can use the non profit system to also gain resources from the government at the same time. Right. So to build our resource base and then we maintain and control what we're doing through group member ship, group membership direction. Right. Which is then so I mentioned to you the other night that PPC and how everybody would together own the maintenance or the oversight of the resources that are being brought in, right, and utilized.

00:56:26:03 - 00:56:49:08
Unknown
And so that's basically what I did is I said, okay, that's the process that I think we need to focus on. And that's what I've built a model based on, around how can what do I see in the system can be used to do what we need to do? Okay, great. That's that's excellent. Thank you. Yeah. So, let's move on to something else here.

00:56:49:23 - 00:57:12:19
Unknown
So, I've from what I've known from you so far, you've been doing a lot of traveling. You seem to be at a lot of festivals. I've heard a little bit about you that you, play an instrument. You have some musical background, and I guess I'd like to, talk about your the music and cultural events you play a role in, in your work.

00:57:13:12 - 00:57:39:08
Unknown
And how you got involved with these events and, what part? What that what that does for you and and how you've been able to kind of, work with the community. And you know, what what are you doing when you're flying around, Okay. Yeah. Well, I'll I'll start by saying my music career started in Tucson when I was getting my PhD.

00:57:39:21 - 00:58:07:18
Unknown
Luckily, I ended up landing in a band that was local that was moving from local to regional and was kind of when you're, you know, your home band, you have a large, fan base in your home area. But the goal, of course, is to expand your fan base. And in any artist there, their goal is to expand their fan base right to, to to make people, know who they are in different places.

00:58:07:20 - 00:58:47:19
Unknown
Right. So, that's kind of, where my career started connecting with events, right? That, that were, happening. And that moved me into different, festival communities. And when I say festival communities, I'm seeing communities that throw different events that are arts and music based. Right. Versus the, the, the other system that throws events, which is not community based but is capitalist to base.

00:58:47:19 - 00:59:40:09
Unknown
So if you go to a show at the Mission Ballroom, right, you are paying an organization that set up this artist's performance. That is a corporation that is again using the word extracting, using your fandom of the artist to extract resources from you. Right? Well, if you go to a festival, you it's more it's more than not, a, a corporation that is putting on this event, it's usually a group of people from the community festival community artists, production people.

00:59:41:22 - 01:00:15:07
Unknown
The, the, the talent themselves. Many of the talent themselves is often local, involved, vendors, artisans, vendors. Right. They're all coming together and contributing to this event to create that event. And so, that's an excuse that's different in terms of, the extraction and potential. It's more of like a shared, like sharing potential.

01:00:15:09 - 01:00:48:07
Unknown
And that's, what attracted me to the, the festival, experience. Right. It's that sharing. And I'm the big purveyor of, cooperative exchange so that we are exchanging and providing a resource in exchange for other resources that we need. Right. And when you see a festival, happen, you see a lot of cooperative exchange, right?

01:00:48:09 - 01:01:18:22
Unknown
That's happening saying, hey, I'll do this in order for this event to happen. And with the, the hope or the plan that this comes back to me. So I quickly learned the difference between them. Direct exchange and indirect exchange. Right. So direct exchange is more about this is what I'm going to do, and I'm going to get this specifically back.

01:01:18:24 - 01:01:43:23
Unknown
And cooperative or indirect exchange is more about I'm going to contribute to this larger thing and that larger that contribution together with everybody's contribution is going to give something benefit some larger community that I'm a part of. Right. So kind of so-called programing, which is something you were kind of working on in your education. Yes. Right. So yeah.

01:01:44:01 - 01:02:19:23
Unknown
And that's good. That's exactly right. And and so that, that's what attracted me to it and to to basically try to help streamline that. And we've it's, it's, you know, it's it's really difficult, because people are coming with the, the traditional structure in mind that says, okay, direct exchange, I need direct exchange, I need to get paid for this thing that I'm doing directly to benefit me.

01:02:20:00 - 01:02:45:18
Unknown
I don't do anything unless I am getting directly benefited. So you need to show me the direct benefit that I get for being a part of this. And that seeps that, that that's what makes it difficult sometimes to be able to say, you know, hey, no, this is not we're not asking you to to, have a direct, exchange relationship.

01:02:45:18 - 01:03:17:23
Unknown
We're asking you to do an indirect or a, you know, a cooperative exchange relationship and teaching. So we have to teach people the benefit of cooperative and indirect exchange. And re socialize them out of the need for direct exchange, because often direct exchange is a quick fix or a the result is, minimal in terms of the impact that it causes.

01:03:17:23 - 01:03:48:06
Unknown
Right. One person walks away with, you know, you know, $2 million, and an event that took in $3 million. How is that beneficial in the long run, even to that person? Because that person is going to be in the community, seen as someone who's extracted a crapload from this set of 30 or 40 people who put together this event all together.

01:03:48:06 - 01:04:19:23
Unknown
And it just seems like very unfair. And so that person is not going to be seen as a positive person in the community and will likely lose their place in the community because of it. So in the long run, the direct exchange demand, a direct, you know, exchange is not as beneficial as, as community and indirect and, cooperative exchange.

01:04:19:23 - 01:04:51:24
Unknown
Right. So there you go. So that that's, that's so that's the basis of, what connected me to to and why I wanted to be involved in like, festivals and things like that. And so I have, helped produce a lot of different festivals. I produced my first one done alone out of meaning, being the director of one down in Tucson, the Wild, Wild West Fest, which kind of bears my, DBA, when I'm producing festivals and events.

01:04:51:24 - 01:05:22:15
Unknown
Some of it, is wild Wild West festivals. And that one, you know, it usually it didn't break even. Didn't, you know it was in the red. But, there's a but I didn't I didn't stop, right. I knew that, cooperating can still, can still work. And and it has worked in smaller situations. So and I think that's really important the I understanding that it does work in smaller community situations.

01:05:22:17 - 01:05:56:02
Unknown
And we can concentrate on doing things in smaller networks, but and then bringing nodes that develop in smaller networks together to create larger, larger, needed events and needed situations, it's better. So if we think about how, humans thrived in tribal, you know, in tribal, cultural situations, right? Everybody who lived in this tribe did not produce everything that they needed.

01:05:56:04 - 01:06:18:23
Unknown
And everyone who produced lived in this tribe produced what they could produce, but they didn't produce everything that they needed. They would go to markets. They would exchange with the larger communities of things that were surplus. Right. For one community that the other community needed in exchange for surplus for what? This other community had, that this community needs.

01:06:19:00 - 01:06:53:00
Unknown
That's clearly cooperatives, exchange. Right? Yeah. So I and I oh, okay. No, no, no I'm good. You can Yeah. So and I've seen from what you've said so far, some reflections in, in your work where, you know, I would say that Burning Man is a good example of multiple tribes coming together. And being on the same plane, literally, and kind of, you know, sharing each other's resources and experiences and learning from each other.

01:06:53:00 - 01:07:25:02
Unknown
And there, you know, everyone's got their own area where they're setting up big events and they're got a line up on their stage. And, you know, it definitely it's kind of like that moment where everyone comes together and it really kind of proves that this is correct. The right way to do. Definitely one. Yeah. And and in fact, you you even found grants for some people to go there and produce their art, which kind of, which is an interesting angle to all of this, because, yes, people, need to get beyond that.

01:07:25:20 - 01:07:48:13
Unknown
You know, give me something before I give you something kind of mentality with the community. But at the same point, they do need to put food on their table while they focus on art, which can take a and, a lot of time, as I'm sure you, and it becomes like a, a passion and, a focus and it's actually kind of my favorite flow state.

01:07:48:13 - 01:08:18:09
Unknown
It's like being in the, in the moment, working on art is just amazing. It makes me realize, you know, how much of a person I can be when I'm in that state versus, you know, working on something in business or whatever, right. And, so, I'm wondering if, there's, you know, you you talked about, the bloom, organization and I'm wearing shorts.

01:08:18:11 - 01:08:45:11

Is that related to the Bloom Festival or something like that, or are what are you doing right now in terms of, building community cultural programing, you know, how does how does music and culture fit into your larger vision? Well, the Bloom network is actually a sustainable, sustainable network that is focused on, each sub bloom or you call them blooms, right?

01:08:45:13 - 01:09:12:07
Unknown
Are basically they're called blooms because they're blooming something some kind of programing in their local space. That is helping them to be to provide sustainable services or product development. Right. So, so a lot of them are food systems people, you know, and it's it's blooms all over the world. So there's Africa blooms. There's blooms in South America, right?

01:09:12:09 - 01:10:00:08
Unknown
Blooms, the United States one here in Boulder. And so the bloom the the, the blooms network, is kind of twofold. They are it is working to develop cooperative exchange. But at the same time, the network itself is kind of seeing itself as more of a philosophy oscillator of the, cooperative exchange, and the work that each bloom is doing and kind of being like a cheerleader and the promoter of their work and helping them to at the same also to find resources that will help them to do the work they need.

01:10:00:08 - 01:10:50:04
Unknown
So, a cheerleader, a organizer and a resource developer, right? Promoter, organizer, and resource developer, that kind of role is what the Bloom Network is doing. And I, was asked to kind of help, contribute in doing some contributing of, you know, grant writing and not just grant writing, but the, like, assessment. I did like the work with their, needs assessment to try to figure out what exactly, we need from groups to help them, what information we need to be gathering for, for groups to help them, be able us to be successful, to get grants that would benefit them all, you know?

01:10:50:04 - 01:11:11:01
Unknown
So, is that a fairly new organization or. Yeah, it's started on the path. I've just been involved with them for, like a year or less, less than a year, but they've been around for a couple of years, and it's, it's it's growing. There's like I said, there's blooms all over, it's growing and it's, it's developing.

01:11:11:01 - 01:11:36:14
Unknown
It's still I think it's still has a lot of work to do. And as I kind of said, I'll be involved with it. So it's that, you know, I like their cause what they're doing, they're trying to help people around the world become more sustainable in terms of food systems and water systems and the what I call the basic needs of humans.

01:11:36:15 - 01:12:05:04
Unknown
Yes. You know, I, I see that there's two basic resources that we all need. We all need clean air. We all need clean water. We all need food. Right. And the freedom to be able to, be our own source of food and together be common sources of food for our community. Right? Because we can we can never provide all the food that we need for ourselves.

01:12:05:06 - 01:12:36:23
Unknown
Right. Because there's just certain things that where we are structurally will not allow that to happen. So we have to have community networks, food, producers, communications, transportation. Right. Humans have to get from place to place. We don't have wings. Right. And so those are basic kind of human needs. I feel, that, networks and programing should kind of be addressing.

01:12:37:02 - 01:13:06:09
Unknown
Right. So, in terms of programing, you're asking about, I feel like that's the basis for all programing. What what kind of what programs do we need? We need programs that are to help enhance the transportation of humans. We need programs to enhance the food. Distribution and production, production and distribution of food to the different groups of humans.

01:13:07:09 - 01:13:34:04
Unknown
You know, based on that idea that all humans don't produce every single thing, you need to have to exchange food, right? So that economy of food. So what do we can program Stu to facilitate that economy? Air, water. What programs? Clean air can facilitate clean air can facilitate clean water. Right. And facilitate making sure that people get water.

01:13:34:11 - 01:13:57:18
Unknown
It sucks. It would really suck to have a lot of water around you, but that water be contaminated. And you can't drink it because it's going to kill you. And so what kind of programs are ensuring that the water is not contaminated, the way that programs are ensuring that the air is not contaminated? Right. And that goes back to what our government was supposed to be doing, is supposed to be doing.

01:13:57:18 - 01:14:29:08
Unknown
That's why we set up that government, right? It's supposed to be ensuring that the water we drink is not contaminated, and the air that we breathe is not contaminated. And so my program ideology is clearly connected, to in my program, not just ideology, but the program ideology and the program objectives. Any program that I'm working with or wanting to be involved with or wanting to develop is has to fit into those objectives.

01:14:29:10 - 01:14:59:13
Unknown
Right. And I think that's why I became connected to you guys, because it fits into the overall objectives of what program objectives, of what I believe is necessary for human survival. Yeah. And that's a there's that great way to follow into this last section here. Which is basically about the future, and what we can do together.

01:15:00:00 - 01:15:26:14
Unknown
I know, you said quite a bit about, you know, building smaller communities and nodes of, of culture. And, you know, the, the, the ability that when you scale to large becomes out of control and this idea of like, you know, getting, getting what you need from a smaller community is much easier to do than trying to throw a global event or something like that.

01:15:27:04 - 01:15:56:21
Unknown
And, that is, well, in line with what Matty and I talked about when we first started talking about setting this up, which was, you know, as a, as an artist, it's really hard to get anyone to notice you. And, the wide ocean of the global internet, because everybody's making a little noise, and before you know it, it's just, noise and noise and you really can't see or find anyone in that.

01:15:56:21 - 01:16:22:07
Unknown
And noise is noise. Yes. Yeah. So and and the idea of distributive creatives, especially with, Local artists Network is this whole concept of building communities, around the people in your area, the, the creatives that can come together and put together projects and, you know, one of the things that I'm hoping to do and I'm starting to see this is really important.

01:16:22:08 - 01:16:55:10
Unknown
Important. And what, you know, I went to a grant, thing held by Boulder, and it was ten different organizations talking about, probably 10 to 15 grants each that they're all trying to, award to people in Boulder and Boulder County. So it was very inspiring to see that, that was, yesterday. And they, you know, so I took a lot of notes and I've got this whole game plan now for how to approach them and talk to each person.

01:16:55:10 - 01:17:42:19
Unknown
Right. Writing grants and applying for basically everything. I think distributed creatives, ticks almost every box. And I think some of the things that you're passionate about could, fill in the rest of them. They're, you know, there's a lot of, requests for, indigenous, education and things like that. And, you know, helping minority communities and, like, so I think it's important to, I've wanted to do this, but I think, having you on board is really going to help to solidify the, the methods for getting there, but essentially ensuring that the, networks that we're building are all inclusive.

01:17:43:08 - 01:18:06:10
Unknown
And really, you know, help the right people. Another group is, you know, the youth and children and education. There's a lot of grant opportunities there as well. And then the other thing that I took I did yesterday was I wrote a grant for the, what's it called? The. I forgotten the name of the the the institution.

01:18:06:10 - 01:18:47:20
Unknown
But, for, the EPA, so. Okay. And, so I wrote a whole thing on Distributive Creatives and how they, the local artists network, which is a series of, displays around town, could actually, include, a, an alert system for, you know, environmental issues in your area. So, like, it could just pop up a thing when there's a problem in town, and, it could become an alert broadcast network for that, as well as the possibility of education through that because, the, the land is supposed to have, like a, TV interface where you have menus.

01:18:47:20 - 01:19:15:06
Unknown
So one of the menu options could easily be, you know, learning about that aspect of, and environmental pollution and how to prevent it. And, you know, global and local maps of pollution and, so, like it became really obvious to me that like that, that whole system can really help the community in other ways is, when it's not showing art, it can be educating and providing, you know, local information.

01:19:15:12 - 01:19:34:23
Unknown
So I'd like to say to you that I would see it is even going further, because and I'll give you an image of what you have in my head, why you were talking. You know how now you know, you you can say, hey, Alexis, can you look at the weather for me and tell me what the weather is?

01:19:35:00 - 01:20:13:18
Unknown
Or you can say, Alexa, weather, or you can say, what's the other way? Hey, Google, what's the, you know, the carbon particle content in the air today. What about if you use the land to be more of a proactive situation, like you're saying that, okay, I'm a farmer, and because I'm a farmer, I've programed or the the that I that's a part of the land is aware of the things that I need and just actively like, hello Farmer Sheila today with the, the the content in this soil and the rain.

01:20:14:01 - 01:20:53:13
Unknown
You know, the alkaline content in the rain is higher than normal. You know, maybe you should, you know, suggest that covering up any kind of so and so plants, you know, that your any crops that are growing, you know, the, the air quality is, you know, crappy today, you know, make sure you wear a mask while you're, you know, something like that, where it's it's being, proactively connected, telling you and giving you information that you need relative to your, your, profession or space.

01:20:53:16 - 01:21:20:05
Unknown
I mean, you said art, but, you know, it's a local artist network, but you get what I'm trying to say. Where? Yeah. I'm. Yeah, that becoming, you know, just a social good for all needs. The local artist network being one of those. But. Yeah, because we're building the infrastructure and installing these, in different locations, and maybe the person who runs the space can choose what they're willing to broadcast.

01:21:20:10 - 01:21:59:09
Unknown
Yeah. There we go. And the EPA would love to hear something like that because. Oh, wow. You mean you're putting you're going to be, doing what is it called? Retains the name of them, but, this is a broadcast notice. What were those called? Yeah. Emergency broadcast system. Like, you're you're you're going to be bringing back through technology, PSA public service announcements, but more, more directed public service announcement to the individuals catered to what their needs are.

01:21:59:11 - 01:22:38:01
Unknown
And I think that is a great idea and could pull in potentially a lot of funds. Right. Because city and probably states and other agencies are right now really trying to figure out how to connect with people, especially when we have an administration possibly coming in a federal administration that's saying we're not going to, to ensure that information is, is, not misinformation or.

01:22:38:03 - 01:23:07:04
Unknown
Right. So direct communication, I think is going to be key in the coming months if we are good to go talking about, you know, getting grants and how we can work to, to, to use an electronic interactive system, that you that we are building with this platform. And I think that's, that's ripe. That's ripe right now that would be ripe.

01:23:07:10 - 01:23:44:06
Unknown
Okay. So that. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. Okay. So just to wrap things up here, what what would you like to see? Distributed creatives do and you know, what kind of legacy would you like to create for the organization and yourself? And, how would your can your background strengthen what we're doing? In terms of what I'd like to see, I'd like to see distributed creatives and its products grow into a community.

01:23:44:19 - 01:24:14:05
Unknown
In a manner in which the community does not see what they're producing as foreign to the community, as a product that's being presented to the community. Does that make sense? Yeah. But as it's a product that is being developed by the community and is just naturally organic, growing from the community, I think that's really, really, really important.

01:24:15:00 - 01:24:48:19
Unknown
Because anytime, anytime we we've seen, you know, something being presented to the community as a solution for the community's problems, it's always problematic. Oh, you are the savior that's bringing us something to save us. And that that is that that is I think is is definitely not the, promotional campaign to go with. Yeah. I mean, how can I help you do that?

01:24:49:14 - 01:25:31:08
Unknown
One by making sure that we, create a campaign and a way developing organic web development that is grassroots and coming to the community and and having the community, you know, assessments needs and throughout the whole process, having them involved and saying, oh, yeah. Right. You know, this is a this is clearly something that is, designed for us to be using and for us to design ourselves and to develop, design and, input, give input into the design as we go, and ownership will be developed through that situation.

01:25:31:08 - 01:26:05:21
Unknown
And I can help with that. I can help with connecting the community. And because you asked what I do and like festivals as well as one of the big things, I do lots of workshops and I'm, you know, I'm a teacher, I'm an instructor, I'm a trainer. I can help the community in training and using and doing things with, the platform that's being developed, to show them, in, real time, in actual, education situations of, active learning.

01:26:05:22 - 01:26:33:06
Unknown
Let's see, what's the other word where you are, on hands, on on hands now on hands learning. But doing doing stuff with the platform that is going to be, illustrative of what they do and showing how the use of it will be beneficial to what they're doing. Right. And I think that's kind of stuff that's needed.

01:26:34:07 - 01:27:08:11
Unknown
You know, because a lot of products are developed by people who are members of a community, but often taking pieces in their own mind and saying, okay, this is how we can do this, and this is what we should do. And then we present that piece to people and then do the R&D research and development to find out if what we did, works, rather than developing it by slowly but surely interacting with the community that's going to be using it and seeing this piece, working in this piece, working together, they're coming together.

01:27:08:11 - 01:27:34:11
Unknown
And those pieces work together. And then it's an organic growth process, which I feel that is totally. Yeah. And that's what I've been experiencing personally because I've been, you know, I've been working with one local, and their, their vision is much grander than just creatives. And, and I've been talking with Mattie about this too, where, we're kind of a subset of what one local is.

01:27:35:00 - 01:28:22:20
Unknown
And it started to become clear that, you know, the when and, I've already applied with one local for this EPA grant. And that's when I started realizing that the, the network of digital displays was like, perfect for a community way beyond just creatives. Right. And so I'm starting to I may I'm, I'm pivoting a little bit on that, that network of, displays being something, and of its own or perhaps, in working in conjunction with one local and there the benefit to that is, Cameron and their group are working really hard on it being, governance by the people.

01:28:23:09 - 01:28:46:06
Unknown
So that, you know, and using like, structure. That's fair. So, no, Cameron's not interested in running the show. He wants it to be decisions by people for people. So, like, there's a a great opportunity there for you and I and for distributed creatives and for all these initiatives to kind of work together on building the bigger picture.

01:28:46:20 - 01:29:19:00
Unknown
So just something I wanted to throw out there. But yeah, distributed creatives can be a technological sector of one local. Yeah, exactly. It's not necessarily a subset. It's it's something that the that can be developed by distributive creatives that can be utilized to help one local do its, you know, overall mission while at the same time, distribute creatives can be, working to fulfill a portion of its mission, which is to help the artist in their community.

01:29:19:02 - 01:29:49:21
Unknown
And, yes, what's being done at hand? Yeah, I think that, yes. You know, like, you can you can throw an event where the proceeds go to, the causes that the community is interested in seeing happen, you know, so it's not just, yeah, it's not siloed money going off and doing its own thing and and not really thinking about the, you know, holistic, concept of the community that you're a part of.

01:29:49:21 - 01:30:19:15
Unknown
So I think, yeah, you know, that really helps kind of in terms of, you know, community programing, it really helps to show how that works to people at a grassroots level where it's like, look, you're you played this event and now this is happening in your community. Yes. That kind of connections I agree. So yeah, anything you want to, finish or anything you want to make sure is in your bio that we haven't covered.

01:30:19:17 - 01:30:45:01
Unknown
Oh, I just, I mean, the particulars of my bio are, are pretty much in the CV, the particulars of things I've done. And I think the ideological stuff that you hear today gives you a sense of, you know, the, the, how I've tied those things all together. And I think that's mostly important. And, and you can pick and choose when you're using the information.

01:30:45:01 - 01:31:12:03
Unknown
What, what you should and I yeah, I mean I yeah, it's, it's way too long to try to summarize my, you know, 30 years of, doing stuff in community in, in education, which is a lot it seems like kind of crazy, right? Yeah. So yeah, it's I think it's more about. Okay, what what do we need for this grant or what do we need for this program to show, you know, what do I need to highlight?

01:31:12:05 - 01:31:35:19
Unknown
So when doctors Doctor Hewlett is involved, what is dodgy, let me tell, pulls from his, you know, his repertoire, to utilize. And then you can do that by presenting a short blurb relative to those things. And then I will know when it's time for me to present and walk in what I'm highlighting from my background sounds great.

01:31:35:19 - 01:32:01:19
Unknown
And yeah, I'll look over the CV and, there might be I might have some like General questions on the, statistics and numbers like X number of grants and X number of years in like. But I'll look at the CV first and see how much is there, because I just want to because like you said, I have I have a 30 year history that it's impossible for me to summarize.

01:32:01:19 - 01:32:24:23
Unknown
And that's why I wanted to do it in this format, where you could just kind of talk about stuff so you didn't have to just try to contain it all on a page. I think this is good. Yeah. I mean, yeah. All right. And we should talk to you a lot more about because I've got to podcast things that I need to get, get out there and, and, and, and, and want to continue and get back into podcasting.

01:32:24:23 - 01:32:46:11
Unknown
And so maybe, you know, we should definitely talk about how we can do some promotional materials, you know, for distributed creatives that will also be involved with other promotional cross promotions, that's necessary. Yeah. And I really hope to work with you on stuff in 2025. I, you know, I will take I will take you up on that offer.

01:32:46:13 - 01:33:05:21
Unknown
Okay. Good writing up right now that the three different thing sets of needs that I have and they're going out to different people. So yes. All right. Okay. Sounds good. I could have a great night. I'm going to go and shoot some things. Well I'm down to Texas. All right okay. Talk to you later. Great. Take care. Bye bye.

01:33:05:21 - 01:33:08:06
Unknown
Bye.
