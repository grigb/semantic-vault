- notion dictated
    
    My parents were always very supportive of my music career period. It started very early when I was About seven. At that point, I remember going to see a bluegrass band. and falling in love with the fiddle.
    My dad...
    It plays the accordion.
    and was very interested in encouraging me at an early age. Period. At that point, we were living in New York.
    They found me a private tutor from Juilliard.
    I spent about five years playing violin and at the peak of my experience I was The second chair in the Boulder Youth Symphony.
    I was also a...
    Quartet in Boulder, colorado that played
    At venues throughout Boulder.
    As I reached early adolescence, my interest changed to early music and I remember trying to find electronic music at that point and it was very difficult. One of the first bands I ended up trying to get into and really... Learning from was...
    kraftwork.
    There wasn't really much else to listen to that was strictly electronic music. Later on, I found out that there were, of course, other bands that were doing things with electronic keyboards and synthesizers. But at that point, it was pretty hard to find.
    That definitely started my early collection of music and I would spend a lot of days going to music stores. Music stores and looking through what was available on the shelves and listening to pretty much everything I could get my hands on.
    then I would say at some point I formed several small Electronic bands.
    Inspired by...
    9 inch nails, skinny puppy, and that sort of thing.
    I also started my earliest solo electronic music, which I'm still working on today roughly 35 years later. When I ran into a bunch of people in the last years of high school formed a band with my brother and friends and that lasted almost 20 years. When we first started the band, we were all pretty new to things I would say I probably had the most background, but it didn't take long for my brother who is excellent at guitar to pick things up. He had a basis who was inspired as well. We were all into the 70s music a lot like the doors, Pink floyd, led zeppelin , jimmy Hendrix, eric clapton.
    
- early music
    
    At that time everyone in our band got very interested in music theory, learning and exploring music in general, and I had a very large collection of eclectic music from electronic music to punk and things like back and Indian music and you name it, I was listening to it and sharing it with the group.
    
    It was around the same time that we all decided to find professional jazz musician teachers and that's when I started my work and study with Art Land period.
    
    He was a amazing pianist jazz artist and drummer in Boulder at the time and I think he's moved somewhere else and is still performing all the time period I think the biggest influence was probably the jazz because it really allowed me to understand form and how to do intervals and create dissonance and really listen to music.
    
    But there were so many other influences in Indian.
    
    I really liked Zakir Hussein and Ravi Shankar many other artists are slipping my mind right now, but it was a lot.
    
    We eventually got pretty good at jazz and I think my jazz influences are still influencing the work that I do today.
    
    So that was the beginning playing together right out of high school and then it ultimately we moved to San Francisco in 2000 to play to a bigger audience and try to embed ourselves in the electronic music scene, which was kind of the angle that our music was going for somewhere between Pink Floyd and Electronica That was the term at the time.
    
    Eventually we moved on and played our own venues and I ended up purchasing a very large sound system, which we used to secure early gigs by playing the gigs and supplying the sound for the events.
    
    So it's a great deal for those early people to the scene who needed sound systems all they had to do was let us play.
    
    It was a lot of work.
    
    At some point, the band broke up as all bands, I suppose, do.
    
    And that was roughly the same time actually a little bit before that was the time that uh we created attic tech, which was a music download store and that was hugely successful, mainly because we gave the majority of the music sales directly to the artist. Somewhere between 70 and 80%. That allowed us to give the artists about two million dollars in the first sixteen months, which I think really has a lot to do with where I am today, trying to create a model for that whole experience . But at hundred percent, a nonprofit , the people around me really loved what we were doing and we ended up playing all sorts of electronic gigs.
    
    There was around that same time that my electronic moniker neuro not was pretty popular and I was getting gigs at outdoor festivals as well as running sound systems.
    
    Also during that time we were recording our own albums and I ended up diving deep into the science of sound and became a mastering engineer.
    
    I never really got too far with that because I stopped trusting my own ears . But that's a whole other story.
    
    There's a lot that I am skipping over, but essentially for 20 years in the San Francisco Bay area, we became a dominant force for the underground electronic music scene and many artists still playing today will remember those times Artists like Tipper and base nectar and Glitch mob are some of the ones that are probably well known.
    
    We also created our own label called atticec records, which did exceptionally well and we were able to press a lot of vinyl and sell a lot of digital downloads for our artists.
    
    I think that model is still something I'd like to see happen with Musley and distributed creatives. I think attic tech published about 100 releases Mine was the first from the neureronaut moniker that I had been using for many years.
    
    Early artists included E prom, lawgivers, audio void brand Richards vent OPU Bird of prey casantila, side bag, the fruit bat digital rest.
    
    AMB bird of prey, spoon bill, fine cut bodies, griff , Ivank, Bill Bless, bog trotter, So yeah, a whole bunch of electronic musicians that we had met over the years who wanted to work with us.
    
    I should also mention that there is a whole parallel phase where I was doing my own music and I find that really rewarding because I was trying to really translate my feelings for a more beautiful, complete world into art and creative outputs and I probably spent most of my free time doing that when I wasn't working. I always found the intersection of music and technology absolutely fascinating and the deeper I went into understanding how music and sound worked.
    
    I became more and more in love with that.
    
    I also spent a lot of time kind of diving into the spiritual side of that by reading a lot of works and kind of trying to find that middle ground between science and spirituality and there were some really good pieces out there.
    
    Most of them that really resonated with me were more about how to get the flow going. I was also reading a lot of Tibetan mysticism and Alan Watts and I felt like it was an important part of being a creator and a musician was to understand the philosophical side of life.
    
    And I believe it really did enrich my understanding of the world and I definitely experienced a few ego deaths along the way, which I now think are an essential part of being humble and serving humanity. During the 20 years of being in the bay area, we attended many events.
    
    I probably went to a new festival or repeating festival every weekend for about 15 years.
    
    So I've definitely been part of that scene and look forward to coming back to them and offering them the new stuff we're building for distributed creatives, which really is the next level where we really give everything we can to the creators so that they can survive.
    
    I think one of the crucial things that I learned during all of this was that it's really hard to be paid enough to make a career out of being a creative person and that's something I've wanted to change my whole life. So that kind of gives you some idea of the basic background of the music side of things.
    
- early dev
    
    
    At the same time that I was being creative with music and other arts, I decided that I was going to live a parallel life of understanding technology and computer science.
    
    And I think I found a balance between both sides of the brain, as they say, the creative and the technical and that has served me well, I believe . Early on, I was supported by my dad who really was quite keen on getting me into computers as early as possible.
    
    And while I was still in grade school, maybe it was junior high, he purchased a Mac 256, which was the early black and white Macintosh.
    
    And I started learning how to do things on there.
    
    Early on, they sent me to computer camp, which I believe we were using Apple to ease and I would teach classes there to the other students, at least that's what I've been told happened.
    
    I also had a interesting period where I was learning early Apple technologies like hypercard and making stuff out of that and before that even coding stuff with Res edit it, which was an early editor for doing really basic low-level coding.
    
    After that, I took a few classes in C, and this was in the early 90s, so there really wasn't much out there in terms of a degree.
    
    And shortly after that, I built my first app, which was a tool that I think ended up being used for about 20 years in CU Boulder.
    
    It was a way for USGS to track earthquakes on a map and I wrote it in the Atari STE back then there were no tools.
    
    I just wrote in pure C and I managed to generate a topographic map in color and then plot earthquakes as they came in from various instruments.
    
    It also pinged out to pagers so that people could get the data in real time on earthquakes as they happened around the planet.
    
    It was basically a kiosk that sat in the offices of series, which was part of USGS, I believe, in CU Boulder for, like I said, 20 years.
    
    I was really proud of that.
    
    It was my first experience with merging science and computers and the fact that it was used for so long, and I believe Iris, the seismic detection service anded up borrowing the UI from it , even before that, I remember in grade school drawing UI on paper in the back of the class and then going home and trying to program it.
    
    I remember writing code in basic on sheets of paper and then compiling it at home to see if it would work.
    
    So I think I've been embedded in that for most of my life.
    
    And then I spent, like I said, 50% of my time doing coding and writing stuff and I started multiple companies with multiple individuals and each one we had clients and successes and at this point in my life, I've created about seventy products for different companies and launched them all. Almost all of them, I designed, wrote the code for, did the back end and front end and deployed on my own?
    
    For some reason, I felt it was faster to do than to have to communicate with a group.
    
    Eventually, I learned how to manage and work with others.
    
    And I think my experience of being able to do full stock development really helped with that .
    
- spiritual & philosophical path
    
    I've done a lot of traveling in my life and I think that has played an important role in understanding how lucky we are here in America to have food on our plates and obviously just the quality of life and the potential here is so much higher than some other places that I've traveled to . I spend some time in India two months, I believe, and we did a lot of research on sacred sites where we would go and with a professor from the area interpret Sanskrit texts and determine where the temples in the text should be and then we would drive out into the jungle and lo and behold, find ourselves on top of temple spots that no one had known about.
    
    We then did GPS measurements from those points and discovered that they were aligned in the shape of the Ganges River and I think there was a sort of growing up period there seeing the world for what it really was and traveling with my girlfriend at the time.
    
    We also went to Nepal and Fiji and I spent time in Mexico and I've traveled to all the states.
    
    I've been to Canada for events that I performed at.
    
    I did a tour of Europe where I performed my solo music at castles in Scotland and flew to France for an event or two.
    
    I've wanted to travel more, but it's expensive. My time in India was significant.
    
    I was reading a lot of books on Buddhism and we went and visited Bodkaya where the Buddha was enlightened . We spent time with local spiritual leaders.
    
    We went to Mahakumba, Mahakumb, which is a grand confluence of faith, culture, and the ritual is to pilgrimage to these places traveling in circles that represent the universe period.
    
    I remember asking a spiritual leader there out of all of the readings that they had memorized by turning them into songs, what was the greatest lesson of all?
    
    He replied it was the golden rule which he thought was important enough to leave with me that being due unto others as you would have done unto yourself.
    
    I also said the fortunate experiences while in bolder to meet and spend time with Robert Fenosa and Terrence McKenna and Martina Hoffmann.
    
    Terence McKenna and I got along really well and I ended up working with him a little bit and creating some art pieces and a website.
    
    I also created the website for Venosa, which I think is still being run by Martina today.
    
    It was an early site.
    
    Looks out of date today.
    
    Anyway, Terence McKenna was really kind and took me in and we went around the circuit of events and I got to kind of hang out and be a friend and a groupie at the same time . He inspired me deeply and I learned a lot from him.
    
    It was a magical time for me.
    
    I miss him.
    
    I also met Ram Dass in California. And I was equally impressed with him.
    
    His understanding, the and the books that he writ written, which I had read thoroughly by then, were really groundbreaking for me.
    
    I remember him telling me that he was impressed with my ability to speak about spiritual matters.
    
    It's something that you ultimately pick up when you read a lot about those things.
    
    There's a certain flow and understanding and vocabulary that allows you to speak about deeper connections and I really got a chance to chat with Ram Das at that level. I spent a lot of time in Marin County, which had a lot of pseudo spiritualism, if you will.
    
    And I've seen that side of things as well.
    
    I think there is some genuine stuff going on, but there's also a lot of misguided energy. That reminds me I also did some music study at the Aliakbar school of music in San Rafael, California.
    
    I learned vocal training there and it was also a valuable lesson for me. Both spiritually and musically. .
    
    I read a lot, probably everything I could and listen to everything I could from Terence McKenna, Alan Watson, Eckart Doley.
    
    It really helped me find a center and find a reason for the chaos around me, which was the San Francisco Bay area at the time.
    
    There's a lot of mixed up energy, not everybody wants to be your friend and I was used to wearing my heart on my sleeve.
    
    I had to find a way to not close myself off and be that happy shining light that I respected of myself while still walking the streets with people who were basically psychic vampires and who knows what else?
    
    So the work of Alan Watts and Eckart Tully were absolutely groundbreaking for me.
    
    I think after reading hundreds of books the stuff that really hit home was the work of. Stoicism, which in some places gets a bad name, but I really believe that by meditating on our finality and how short our lives are, we gain power to do things for others and ourselves that we wouldn't normally do.
    
    It's hard to take life for granted when you can remember how precious it is and how short it is. One western summary of this that I remember being pretty good is called a guide to the good life, the ancient art. Of stoic joy. By William Irvine, but that pales in comparison to some of the original works.
    
- addictech
    
    So a little bit more about Addictech Our strategy was pretty simple.
    
    I would work my ass off and do everything necessary to make it happen.
    
    We didn't take any money from anyone.
    
    And ultimately, we made millions for the creators.
    
    I learned how to use Amazon web services and was one of their first actual users.
    
    We were so early to it primarily the storage and EC2 instances that we had two call up their tech and talk to them and even their tech advisors had no idea, they would end up having to call somebody else as well.
    
    It was also new that it was changing all the time like most technology does.
    
    We built the system using physical servers at first before Amazon was really even available.
    
    And it was clear to me really quickly that that was needed to be upgraded.
    
    I handled a lot of automation tasks and building of systems as they were required by our artists.
    
    Essentially, we would start making money pretty quickly and then we had to start documenting that and then eventually built a system so that each artist could log in and check their balances and see that they were indeed making the money they were hoping to make . I think that accountability was super important.
    
    The tools also allowed for customized pages, so each artist could create a landing page dedicated to them and alter the styles of the page.
    
    Shortly after that we created the first streaming radio service and I think one of the most unique things about what we did is we use tagging and a group of curators who knew the genre as well would listen to every single song and add the tags to define them.
    
    We then used those tags to create incredibly accurate and wonderful listening experiences and a streaming radio solution that I think is still better than the things you get today. Mainly because it was curated and the tagging system would allow you to say, you know, I want deep base and I don't want vocals and I want this tempo range and essentially it would make sure that each song was something you hadn't heard before and it would really expose the catalogue to new ears.
    
    And encourage a lot of people to buy stuff they would never have heard any other way.
    
    Attic Tech was successful for about 16 years before I sold it and moved on. Like I said before, it proved to me that it was possible, and the reason we ended up getting so many people on board was because we really were giving them so much more than the other options out there.
    
    We ended up with almost every artist from the genre joining and the headliners at the festivals were keen to get as much of the money back from their fans as possible.
    
    It was a huge success at the time. It also helped build an amazing culture and we went from me walking into venues with a handful of vinyl for DJs to play that night too them downloading high resolution files and playing them.
    
    I think we were one of the first to offer lostless downloads . Addictech was formed the same year as the iPod was released 2004. .
    
    It's because of my experience building that system and automating the back end so that it would run seamlessly without attention, that I am so sure that what we're building today is possible.
    
    I'm also quite aware of the things that could suck our time away and am clear enough now on my management and planning that I won't make that mistake again.
    
    You know, the sort of thing where you spend six months on a feature because you don't understand it or managing performance issues when scaling to hundreds of thousands of users in a day At one point we were hit with a DDos attack and I learned my lesson there about how to recover from, I guess somebody being upset at our success .
    
- tech career
    
    In 1994, I released the seismic monitor for USGS and Iris, and that was the start of my technical career that essentially kept me working my entire life.
    
    I think I've spent more time working than anyone I know.
    
    I created a bunch of e-learning tools for people like Jefferson, Norwest Bank, Tetech, lucent technologies, Mall of America, McGraw Hill, MBC, PBS, Dull the NIH and I also did a lot of high end corporate presentations I did an early iMac animation sequence for Everest iMac.
    
    So I have a lot of experience with creator tools.
    
    One of my first jobs was at a design firm and marketing agency where I was considered the expert at digital tools.
    
    I would use the first version of Photoshop there version one I'm still using that today, of course.
    
    I tried to do stuff for the people on the socials slash spiritual side of my life, like Terrence McKenna and Robert Venosa.
    
    I build stuff for people selling Tara paintings and did quite a bit of that sort of thing before leaving Boulder and heading to San Francisco, where the text stuff really started to pick up. My design agency and personal company did stuff for caterpillar, Merk, Gllaxo Smith Klein, pfizer , And then there was a period where I worked for Lazlo systems, where I built tools using their language as demos and ultimately helped other companies write with the Laslo code as well. And experience with [oneU.com](http://oneu.com/) earthlink, leint , bare color paint, which is a kiosk that is still running today in Home Depots Abe worked briefly for Warner Brothers, making music apps for social media.
    
    Each one basically was stylized for the artist, so I worked with Miranda Lambert, taking back Sunday, Mike Jones, Talbquell.
    
    I even did something for Al Gore and live Earth.
    
    After that is basically when I started launching attic Tech and that took over for quite some time on the side.
    
    I also worked for some local companies doing custom work for them.
    
    I worked with auto desk and some of course, where companies in San Francisco eventually I got into augmented reality and built stuff for AbBV Humira and visquira , which was a company in San Francisco building stuff for the hollow lens.
    
    I developed a interactive 3D visualization and unity for USGS.
    
    At some point we did a redesign for attic tech after that. Using react and more of the LAME postgres and Do stuff. Created a bunch of music apps and ultimately got hired by Mixed Men as her CEO to create a musical NFT DJing app for streaming and social media, which I still want to work on some more After that, I got into blockchain when I was working with Chia early on, they gave me a grant to write Mintor, which is a tool that is still available today.
    
    I think they made it in about 2023. And it's still one of the best ways to manage a collection of NFTs and mint it.
    
    It can mint to any chain now and it integrates with composable media, which is something that I pushed forward on composable NFTs are what I believe is the future and was part of what was missing from the mixed man modify app a way to track royalty and provenance I think some of the most interesting stuff came after that, but significant to this interview is the concept of being paid a $60,000 grant to deliver We rather I finished all of the code that was part of the requirements for the grant before they even paid us.
    
    I then released it free, and is still available free today, and I hope to keep pushing it forward. And adding more to it along those lines I've integrated some concepts for the metverse.
    
    And I've been working with the metaverse standards for them to define those standards and then build them into the minting tool.
    
    The idea is that you should be able to document the data to such a degree that you can make them interoperable with gaming and metaverse technologies.
    
    Since then, I've become somewhat ever celebrity in the Chia Society, uh community . I've launched a few NFT projects, which are basically heavy on the tack and pushing the envelope for composable NFTs and integration with rendering engines using unity.
    
    We just released something called the trash formers, which sold out instantly . It uses composable 3D objects and has a backstory that I spent a year writing.
    
    I really enjoy integrating storylines with NFTs and building a universe around it.
    
    My hope is that it takes some of what I gain from my interest in the hitchhikers's guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, which I still love very much.
    
    And the influences of writing sci-fi comedy, which is a wonderful niche market with not much going on in it.
    
    I think the trash farmers could do well there.
    
    I'm hoping to get the book published.
    
    It's a 25 chapter book after that I hope to get children's books on the shelves with the trash formers.
    
    I mean, who doesn't love robots made of trash exploring the universe ? I also want to put out the audiobook, which I developing using AI voices because I don't really like the sound of my own voice.
    
    And maybe one day somebody will want to turn it into a film.
    
    I also think there's some possibility of a metaverse game or some sort of game that integrates the NFTs.
    
    There's also some potential to create games where you trade the parts of the NFTs and create new combinations of robots for battles.
    
    Lots of opportunities there.
    
    And now I'm thinking about how that can get translated to music and other creative works where mixing things together allows artists to collaborate without having to create deals.
    
    They can just create a license on chain and receive royalties from anyone that uses their content.
    
    All of this stuff has been built and we're now at the phase where we want to implement it.
    
    And I basically did a hard pivot towards nonprofit because I wanted to make sure this stuff really gets used and by offering it for free, I think there's a greater potential for it to be adopted There's now a section on the distributed creatives about this called composable NFTs and that kind of moves us into the next step, which is my vision of what we can build.
    
- current status at orgs
    
    I'm currently the executive director and co-founder of distributed creatives.
    
    I'm also the CEO and co-founder of some set tech and [NFTr.pro](http://nftr.pro/).
    
    I'm also a co-chair at the metaverse standards forum and a founder and board member of the ExH foundation . The ExH foundation is a nonprofit for onboarding more people to the chia blockchain ecosystem.
    
    The metaverse standards forum is working on standards um and basically at the co-chair meetings, I lead the digital assets management group that work group is responsible for identifying needs in the metaverse for interoperability , which is perfect.
    
    And I ended up writing a and deploying a document called the metaverse metadata directory, which you can find at [MVMD.org](http://mvmd.org/).
    
    That is my gift of the world, I guess, of how we could use interoperable schemas to connect metaverses together and it enables many different types of standards to mix together so you can have stuff from Pixars. And other 3D formats mixed together to define the building blocks of elements in the metverse.
    
    I think it'll also become useful for attestation and metaverse passports and digital ID and verifiable credentials.
    
    I'm also considering and have been invited to be a board member and co-chair at the Oma 3 organization where we would be focusing on building a name server for digital identification.
    
- fusion and monkeyzoo
    
    One of the projects that I'm launching now is for a NFT project that's super successful on the Chi blockchain called monkey zoo.
    
    It uses a technology that we developed called Fusion . fusion allows for NFT use to be merged together to create new NFTs and those NFTs can be traded, peer to peer, that launches this month, sometime, and I hope to use that technology, which can be open sourced or at least given to the community to build a whole suite of composable NFT solutions backed by distributed creatives and available on the Musley social media site.
    
- future vision
    
    My vision of the future is really to give ownership back to the creators who have been taking a smaller and smaller cut of the proceeds as hundreds of creator platforms do what they can to please their shareholders.
    
    This is created a gap between the artists and creators of the world and the opportunities around them.
    
    I think we've basically lost a huge amount of the world's creative works to this current corporate climate.
    
    And my hope is that our nonprofit can finally make a change and offer something special I really do believe that these technologies are always going to evolve and there is one initiative calledver sites, which may have a name change in the future, but the idea is that we will store the data as Jason using the schema dotorg in a way that allows for the data to be recreated by AI in the future depending on the type of viewing experien people expect.
    
    Right now, HTML pages are still dominant.
    
    But even those have evolved a bit and it would be great to see an AI be able to generate new versions of websites based off of the archive data . Every day somewhere in the world creat's life's work vanishes to the digital void.
    
    We've lost a lot mass, platform extinctions, virtual reality installations, photographic archives.
    
    It's pretty hard to imagine what we will never get back again and the forever sites initiative slash program is to really preserve that I want to see a way for data to be stored forever and that's what we need funding for because we need to keep paying the node operators on our decentralized networks in order to do that . Beyond just the distributed networks of data storage, I want to store it on long-term media like thousand year CD ROMs and store them in underground vaults.
    
    Ideally, we would also fire them off into space so that even if the world was destroyed, there would be a record.
    
    The idea is really a vision of digital permanence where creators know that their efforts could have a long tale and they could get recognition long beyond their life as the provenance is being stored, the royalties and licensing is being stored, and the chain of creator mixes are stored, showing a historical map of where things came from.
    
    Another part of that is to integrate with AI training systems and allow creators to opt into using their core original work for training . The idea would be that those that training data would be used for AIs that could have a unique advantage over ones that are just scraping the web.
    
    The data we want to store is a magnitude higher than what you would get on a website where people are basically summarizing their ideas.
    
    We want to get the source data.
    
    We want to get the original cuts of films and the manuscripts and the history of the creator and where they were and what they were thinking and when things were published and who they worked with just to true snapshot of what really happened so that when AI starts regenerating art, we can attribute it to the creators that came before it . I think this will really strengthen the bond between the craters and the AI industry, which are currently stealing without paying, yet another way that the creators are losing out . Another thing that we're working on is a social media site that's completely free, which should make the other ones obsolete musely spelted MU SE LY is a social media site, one app, every creator, forever free.
    
    It will be hard to really communicate to creators that they're getting 100% of the profits back , but they will quickly learn.
    
    We think places like Spotify and Ticketaster and Etsy and bandamp and YouTube and Kickstarter and Corsera and sketch Fab and scientific reports and had space and turboquid and patreon and open sea and rariable and indie gogo and fan base are all taking way too much.
    
    It's time to use the technology to free the creators and give it all back.
    
    M Musley has a bunch of basic services in mind.
    
    Some of them others have offered but instead of having to go to many different sites, creators can just come to one place and build a profile and interact with their fans, other creators and monetize . The idea would be ticketing, tipping donations. Selling of memberships like Patreon and newsletters, cross posting, which would push to all the other social media , creating a fed verse, integrated platform is clearly part of it.
    
    Digital sales of any type of file, job boards for finding jobs and posting jobs, group forums for communicating with your groups and fans, a marketplace for selling anything like you would on Etsy, a way to run ads on the platform.
    
    So when you have something special, you can create ads for it.
    
    Affiliate programs for really integrating with outside places that need motivation to run with your creative works and, of course, a way to gamify the whole thing.
    
    This would also include streaming medias, storage and solve the problem of incredible musicians, making fractions of a penny for their life's work.
    
    I think creators from all types will benefit from academics to 3D modelers and people who create films, create software, create fine works of art, create paintings and sculptures and jewelry.
    
    They all need to spend less time trying to get their money and hustling and more time being creative. Another way that we decided to build our technology and I keep in mind that the idea here is to identify the need in the creator economy, the creator class and the community, and then solve it with unique technologies that weren't available before.
    
    So this one is called the local artist network and it allows artists to connect with their community by showcasing their art on digital signage and in an event network. So they can stream their media, they can have their events.
    
    They can connect those events to different locations around town and display it on beautiful, large displays people would be able to buy the art by simply scanning the QR code, which would direct them to the social media site.
    
    We envision doing this as a initial launch in Boulder Colorado, where we want to take the current people who are working with us at various venues around town. And boost their traffic and create a true community of people who are ready to be part of something.
    
    Imagine traveling between venues in a single night, going between each venue and being part of the network.
    
    Every venue would display the current events at the other venues. And because they're working together, they would have a staggered event system.
    
    So you would find yourself getting on your bike with a bunch of other people and biking to the next venue to be at that spot.
    
    This would be more than enough traffic for people because there are embolder thousands of people who would go out on a single night if they knew what was going on by having a series of displays in the windows at different locations, you would really get a sense of continuity as you drove by them.
    
    And eventually it would ask you to it would drive you to find out more once you get in close the the impressions on the screen which there are four hundred40 in a day, one per minute would allow people to really get exposed to what's going on in their town.
    
    We also wanted to support indigenous populations and under represented populations and are making an effort to make sure that a percentage of the art is shown is representative of those groups.
    
    We also want to spend some of that time allowing for public notifications and things going on in an alert system Another part of it is 10% of it will be for sponsors, and that sponsorship funding should be enough to bring in millions of dollars a year.
    
    That's at the scale where we have roughly thirty screens in a town.
    
    Then we want to bridge out to multiple towns and allow each city to have its own local artist network and for each one of those networks to broadcast to the other displays in the other cities, creating a multiity multinational group of artists in a global scale.
    
    We think this is a fantastic opportunity for each local community to build an fan base without having to be lost in a sea of others at a global scale, which is currently how things are working online by using this sort of physical connection, we create a better community, which creates more interest in the community, which introduces new creators and inspires a whole new generation to go out and create. So that's the local artist network and that's something we hope to be launching in 2025?
    
    Another thing we're pushing for is called the show, which is a variety show that'll feature diverse creators reaching a global audience.
    
    Those creators were going to come from various places, including the venues in the local artist network.
    
    Craters will be able to showcase or talent and collaborate with artists worldwide.
    
    Imagine something like the late night show, but purely for creators it would be essentially a variety show and much more modern instead of just studio appearances, we would take you to the artist studio. Using iPhones and other mobile devices people could create more authentic experiences by visiting an artist and creating a segment in those segments could be woven together into a worldwide phenomenon that would then be streamed on our social media site as well as pushed to YouTube with the right adoption rates that alone could fund our nonprofit and with all the money that we hope to get from all of our nonprofit ventures, we hope to give back to the community by providing more services, creating events, making venues free for everyone to use, paying the artist more for their work.
    
    There's so many things we could do with that money if we had enough of it coming in. In the future we also hope to do metaverse integration , which at that point would include ways to do geotagged artwork and spaces allow people to go to virtual worlds, go to virtual concerts.
    
    Much of this stuff I have firsthand experience developing. We believe that distributed creatives will easily be able to pay for itself once we get our initial money that money will go to creating the services that will immediately start generating revenue . Our idea for growing our social media site is to initially just ask the creators to use it for their local artist network adoption.
    
    You sign up on the local artist network and from there you can create a social media account, which points to all of your media.
    
    You upload your media to the social media account, and from there, it's displayed on the on the displays around your town.
    
    So that first group of people will be the core individuals that needed to on board their art anyway.
    
    They needed to create their profile and from there they soon learned that they're earning money and growing a community around them. My hope is in one to four years the whole world will have heard about what we're doing and the money will come pouring in and into the pockets of the creators.
    
    I want to find as many people to work with as possible because it's a huge task as an executive director, I hope to keep the vision and push things forward with our wonderful board of directors.
    
    I think we have an excellent chance.

- Grig’s Chia 3rd year mainnet speech
    
    # **Introduction**
    
    Hello, everyone. I'm Grig, and along with my co-founder, Brandt, we started NFTr.pro in May of 2022. We also established SumSet Tech as a parent company, which works with clients and other institutions to build turn-key solutions, using modern technologies like AI, gaming engines, spacial computing, metaverse platforms, and of course, the Chia blockchain.
    
    While we’re gathered here today to celebrate Chia's 3rd year anniversary of mainnet, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the incredible progress and innovation that has taken place within the ecosystem. Chia’s commitment to solving the hard problems in blockchain has created a strong foundation for the development of disruptive decentralized applications, and we are proud to be a part of the thriving Chia community. 
    
    Working closely with this community of hard core Chia devs has taught us a lot. One of the most important lessons we learned is that building truly decentralized solutions is a selfless act. 
    
    It’s clear, from the growing list of open source projects available today, that the Chia community embraces the cypherpunk spirit, and its commitment to humanity and the big picture. 
    
    This spirit of sharing, and our own personal experiences, have inspired us to build tools that give creators, ALL of the power and rewards.
    
    Peer to peer global trading, which is one of Chia’s most important features, is another way of saying “no middle muddle men.” 
    
    I believe that this lack of a traditional business model scared away the dominators from building web3 tools. It’s clear some people in Web2 are preparing for the future, but it’s in their best interests to delay the inevitable.
    
    # NFTr.pro's Mission
    
    Our mission is simple: to empower creators in the Web3 era, by providing the tools they need to create USEFUL digital assets and to build an evergreen future for themselves. 
    
    Many people have been trained to believe that the limitations and security risks of blockchains can’t be fixed. That is true for most blockchains, but Chia has found ways to innovate and disrupt the global status quo. 
    
    Chia’s peer to peer Offer Files, Clawbacks, and Verifiable Credentials allow us to offer solutions so ground-breaking, that the hardest part is convincing others that it is indeed, all possible on Chia. 
    
    With Chia providing the primitives, we believe that the decentralized global network of 
    
    finance, assets, and information is here. 
    
    It’s now in the hands of us early adopters to be the first through the door. 
    
    Luckily for us, Chia has been supportive through grants, social outreach, and has an effective  system called “CHia Improvement Proposals” or CHIP for short.
    
    # Building on Chia
    
    Over the past few years, we've been working hard to develop solutions that harness the power and security of the Chia blockchain. Our contributions to CHIP-0015 and CHIP-0021 demonstrate our commitment to advancing Chia’s NFT standards. 
    
    CHIP-0015, enhances NFT metadata, enabling rich, structured data that unlocks new possibilities for discoverability and interoperability. 
    
    CHIP-0021, introduces the groundbreaking concept of Composable NFTs, allowing for the trustless combination, division, and upgrading of digital assets on-chain. 
    
    <aside>
    <img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/link_green.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/link_green.svg" width="40px" /> Composable NFTs are essentially modular digital assets that can be mixed, matched, and transformed to create new, unique NFTs with their own properties and value.
    
    </aside>
    
    These standards inject future-proof capabilities into NFTs, paving the way for innovative use cases and redefining digital ownership. 
    
    Additionally, we're actively integrating standards from Apple, Meta, The Metaverse Standards Forum, and leading metaverse platforms, to ensure our solutions are compatible with the latest standards and technologies that will shape the future of the creator-verse.
    
    Last year we launched the beta version of Mintr, which we were awarded a “Chia Cultivation Grant” to build. It simplifies the creation and management of Composable NFTs with extended metadata. 
    
    We have been working on some exciting upgrades for Mintr in 2024 and I look forward to sharing them, soon.
    
    # Provenance in a world of AI
    
    In the rapidly evolving world of AI-generated content, it's becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between works created by humans and those produced by machines. As AI algorithms grow more sophisticated, the need for reliable provenance tracking becomes paramount.
    
    At NFTr.pro, we're working closely with the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) to extend provenance tracking into Chia NFTs. 
    
    This is particularly crucial in the realm of Composable NFTs, where multiple creators may contribute to the evolution of a single asset. With C2PA integration, we can record the edit history of Composable NFTs, providing a transparent and auditable trail of every modification made to the asset over time. This not only protects the rights and recognition of creators but also fosters trust and accountability within the NFT ecosystem.
    
    # Collaborations and Community
    
    One of the highlights of our journey so far has been our collaboration with MonkeyZoo on the FusionZoo project. 
    
    I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Tim, the owner of MonkeyZoo, for his partnership and vision, as well as to the talented dev team behind FusionZoo – Lucky8, Gaerax, and Brandt – for their hard work and dedication. It’s been a real pleasure working with and learning from them.
    
    FusionZoo showcases the potential for Composable NFTs and really highlights the importance of collaboration and community within the Chia ecosystem.
    
    # Looking to the Future
    
    We're excited to continue exploring new possibilities and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with Chia and NFTs. 
    
    We believe that the strength of the Chia ecosystem lies in its community – the developers, creators, collectors, and enthusiasts who share a passion for decentralization and innovation. 
    
    # The Visionaries Behind Chia
    
    I want to take a moment to acknowledge the visionaries behind Chia: Bram Cohen and Gene Hoffman. 
    
    Bram Cohen's BitTorrent, released in 2001, revolutionized content sharing on the internet. The peer-to-peer file-sharing protocol improved download speeds and reduced reliance on centralized servers by splitting files into smaller pieces for simultaneous sharing. BitTorrent has shaped the modern internet, accounting for a SIGNIFICANT portion of global traffic, and fostered the growth of open-source and decentralized communities.
    
    Gene Hoffman, an entrepreneur and technology advocate, founded the Internet Anonymous Remailer in the early 1990s, providing secure and anonymous internet communication. As the director of the Internet Mail Consortium, he developed open standards for email. In 1997, Hoffman successfully lobbied the U.S. government to lift export restrictions on cryptographic software, paving the way for widespread adoption of strong encryption technologies essential for secure digital communication and transactions.
    
    Their combined vision and leadership have positioned Chia as a leading blockchain platform for the development of secure, sustainable, and scalable decentralized applications.
    
    # Closing
    
    Once again, I'd like to congratulate the entire Chia team on this significant milestone. Your hard work, dedication, and vision have laid the groundwork for a more secure, sustainable, and innovative world. We're honored to be a part of this community, and we look forward to working together to create a brighter future for creators and users alike.
    
    Thank you, and happy 3rd anniversary, Chia!
