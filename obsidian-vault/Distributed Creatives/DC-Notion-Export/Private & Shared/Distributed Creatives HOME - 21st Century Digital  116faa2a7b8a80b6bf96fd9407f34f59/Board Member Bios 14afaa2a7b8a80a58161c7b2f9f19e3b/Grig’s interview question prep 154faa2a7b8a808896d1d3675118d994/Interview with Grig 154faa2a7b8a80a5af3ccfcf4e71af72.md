        My parents were always very supportive of my music career period. It started very early when I was About seven. At that point, I remember going to see a bluegrass band. and falling in love with the fiddle.
        
        My dad...
        
        It plays the accordion.
        
        and was very interested in encouraging me at an early age. Period. At that point, we were living in New York.
        
        They found me a private tutor from Juilliard.
        
        I spent about five years playing violin and at the peak of my experience I was The second chair in the Boulder Youth Symphony.
        
        I was also a...
        
        Quartet in Boulder, colorado that played 
        
        At venues throughout Boulder.
        
        As I reached early adolescence, my interest changed to early music and I remember trying to find electronic music at that point and it was very difficult. One of the first bands I ended up trying to get into and really... Learning from was...
        
        kraftwork. 
        
        There wasn't really much else to listen to that was strictly electronic music. Later on, I found out that there were, of course, other bands that were doing things with electronic keyboards and synthesizers. But at that point, it was pretty hard to find.
        
        That definitely started my early collection of music and I would spend a lot of days going to music stores. Music stores and looking through what was available on the shelves and listening to pretty much everything I could get my hands on.
        
        then I would say at some point I formed several small Electronic bands.
        
        Inspired by...
        
        9 inch nails, skinny puppy, and that sort of thing.
        
        I also started my earliest solo electronic music, which I'm still working on today roughly 35 years later. When I ran into a bunch of people in the last years of high school formed a band with my brother and friends and that lasted almost 20 years. When we first started the band, we were all pretty new to things I would say I probably had the most background, but it didn't take long for my brother who is excellent at guitar to pick things up. He had a basis who was inspired as well. We were all into the 70s music a lot like the doors, Pink floyd, led zeplin , jimmy hendrix, eric clapton.
