Love that. I actually don't drink coffee anymore. only drink mushroom coffee. So that's been very nice. It's been very nice.

[@3:23](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=203.5) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

I do. Yeah. But even now it's pretty caffeinated for me now.

[@3:31](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=211.9) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

[@3:35](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=215.22) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Yeah. It's a different kind of caffeine. Well, you know, it kind of now that I don't have a lot of caffeine in my body because I don't drink sodas or anything.

So it was just coffee for me. I feed the caffeine so much. Like I had a cup of coffee at work.

Like a real cup of coffee. And it was the first one in maybe six months or so. And I just found myself being incredibly jittery.

So it's like this is actually, you know, physically affecting me.

[@4:00](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=240.0) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Well, quickly. And the black tea does too. Yeah, in the same way.

[@4:04](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=244.5) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Same kind of caffeination.

[@4:07](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=247.72) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Yeah, I try not to drink it all the time, just so it's useful when I do.

[@4:11](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=251.42) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

[@4:24](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=264.36) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

It's just hoping to capture that. the idea here is to get interesting. factoids and a kind of general understanding of where you've been and where you want to go, stuff that will make sense in the bio.

[@5:10](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=310.16) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

It's crazy. Yeah, nothing was prepared for the kind of weather we've got in the last two weeks. Yeah. It's extreme these days for every one.

[@5:39](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=339.08) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

I know. Is it freezing there?

[@5:42](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=342.68) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Um, it was actually like almost the summer day here.

[@5:46](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=346.6) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Well, in Colorado. But it's warmer a little bit, oddly, you know.

[@6:05](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=365.84) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Yeah, we do get a lot of sunlight and non cloudy days and we don't get that weird extra humid thing going on that makes everything turn to mold in the in the shadow.

[@6:20](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=380.42) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Yeah, exactly. How can somebody say wet so long?

[@6:26](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=386.7) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Well, when you when you come when, know, when I go there, I really notice the humidity, right? Definitely, you know, I would say 20% more humid.

[@6:36](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=396.86) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

But yeah, yeah, okay.

[@6:39](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=399.48) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

It's good for my skin and my hair, but hard not longs if you're not used to it to be wet all the time.

Yeah, for sure. Um, so yeah, um, so I'd love to hear about what shaped you early on, you know, family influences and

parental guidance, spiritual background.

[@7:03](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=423.02) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

[@7:04](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=424.94) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Just a little bit, you know.

[@7:06](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=426.1) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

I am very old. You know that.

[@7:07](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=427.78) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

[@7:25](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=445.42) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Oh, I go outside all the time. I attribute it to not drinking all the poison that everybody drinks.

[@7:37](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=457.56) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Yeah. Yeah.

[@7:38](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=458.6) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

That's pretty much it.

[@7:39](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=459.62) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

That alcohol.

[@7:40](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=460.66) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Yeah. Well, mean, I But I'm like a wine drinker as opposed to like get drunk, fall down. you know, I'm a, I'm a, I'm a chill drinker.

My children. I can't handle it. only weigh like 105 pounds. I have to be very cautious. So there's, there's the star of it all.

I'm a very tiny person. I'm like. five foot two and a hundred and five pounds. I'm uh, I'm here.

I've always been kind of like a little fairy. I've always looked sort of like a little fairy. Um, which shaped pretty much everything in my life to a certain extent, because it's how people, it just definitely changes the way people treat you.

Um, which is sad, but true. Uh, I was born in Chico, California, which is uh, at that time in the, you know, 1969 when I was born, uh, was a lovely little kind of college town.

Very kind of down homey. Everybody drank organic things already. Like the whole organic craze that we're seeing now was already part of my life as a child.

we had kind of a, was my father owned an electrical company, um, and the kind of electrical company that like worked on the Golden Gate Bridge.

So, um, he, he was home, you know, I saw him a lot. So both parents a lot. Um, my parents were married 68 years until my father passed.

Um, they got together in world two. So I am seven of seven children, but I'm definitely the oops child because I am 10 years from my next brother.

So it was very much like being having the time to be with me as an only child, but also having like six brothers and sisters and 21 nieces and nephews when I was born.

So I had a lot of family around, any of attention, maybe too much sometimes, hard to be sneaky. But was pretty well like a cross between a scientist and a nature girl.

like I at four or five, I started getting microscopes like that was what I wanted for my birthday and like little, you know, kits that made light bulbs light and things like that.

I was really into radio shack and that kind of thing, but also very much like into tomboy stuff. So you know, climbing trees and and such.

And at some point, like we lived in a nice house, you know, in a nice neighborhood kind of up on a hill.

And like all our neighbors were doctors and lawyers, but my parents decided I was allergic to milk, which I actually didn't turn out to be true.

And so they decided because they were quite bit older, my mom was 43 when I was born and my father was 50.

They decided I was allergic to milk and bought a goat. So we started like this silly kind of little urban farm when I was about six.

The goat didn't last long in urban farm life with my parents, but I went to school and there was no longer a goat.

But it kind of still had some chickens and things like that. So we had fresh eggs and my mom got very much into gardening.

She was retired or retired from having so many children, I suppose. And basically kind of raised me in this way where it was like, I've had enough kids to know that you'll make your own mistakes.

Like here's the skills, go make them sort of. So my family had been very religious. They were Lutherans, which.

Yes, if you talk to religion, Lutherans are barely religious, but you know, they're the mellower religion. And like my whole family went to Luther League, you know, religious summer camp and things like that.

My mother actually was working at the church a little bit, like I don't know exactly what her role was, but whatever a woman could do at the church.

And then before I was born, so this is six children raised Luther League churches, you know, going to church on Sundays.

And you know, my mother basically knew the Bible left and right, but also was very much of a researcher and a scientist, but you know, from sort of the wrong era for that.

But very wise, you know, very intelligent. So I ask her something about God. I always ask really difficult questions.

Like I ask, I think I ask her who God's mom was and her reply was like, why can't you just ask me?

Why is he berseth stripe? Stripes, I have those answers. You always have to ask these existential questions. I remember at four, wondering,

why I couldn't feel my nephew's soul and asking my mother. I didn't call it a soul, but I was like, okay, there's something beyond this body, and I can feel it from him because we're very close in age and very close in friendship, but why can't I actually touch it or exchange it?

so my mom was just like, oh my goodness, know, you're an interesting child. I guess you're already raised, you may as move out.

But instead, she said, well, you know, told me her story of religion, know, she believed in God and all of those things.

I think very much so she didn't talk a lot about it, but she did. And so she said, go explore religion, like find all your friends that go to church and go to all their churches.

So which was cool. I thought that was a very nice way to introduce me to spiritualism and all the other things.

I spent two years between probably about the age of six to eight, attending any church I could attend on Sunday, or on whatever day.

So you know, Jehovah's Witnesses, all the different churches. is at the time I was a wise child. I was like educated up Montessori, so I was very much like taught to be a thinker, taught to be mindful.

So I was kind of that kid that actually understood was going on. so take away was kind of from the eyes of a child what religion is, silly things like Catholics are mean to kids, right?

They act like kids don't understand and I understood. And so I knew what they were actually saying. And Baptists, you know, feed you a lot and like children, you know, so I like this kind of child perspective religion.

But like at the end of it, I was like, I found actually I found Buddhism. And you know, as a child, you're not really a Buddhist, you know, with no support in your family, you're not a Buddhist, but I liked it.

I think I geared kind of my thoughts and beliefs around kind of the Buddhist principles, because it fit with my lifestyle to, you know, my family lifestyle.

So, from there, I basically kind of said it, I think I said I was a Buddhist for most of my life and like I read, you know, Buddhist texts and things like that, but like never really attended temple things like that.

So, I actually did not attend anything Buddhist until I was like 17, and it turned out to be like SGI, which is something international so it's like Buddhist for greedy people.

But it isn't for greedy people, which I very quickly recognized was pretty some for greedy people. And just I remember sitting there.

And because it was for greedy people, they really wanted to get new people involved. It was like a big thing.

So, they kind of bring me up to the front. I was very, I felt very awkward in the situation because all the praying to paper.

And after all these religions telling me like false idols, I think, you know, things do get into your psyche a bit.

And I was like, this seems really on to false idols, you know, even though I really didn't particularly believe the other either.

It just felt awkward. so. I moved more towards Taoism, which is much more of a philosophy, know, you're not, there's no particular leader in Taoism.

It's just like be good and things happen for you, and things happen for the people around you. So I stuck with Taoism.

So basically kind of raised to be very exploratory. And at the time, you know, we're talking early 70s, I was very, like I said, very much into science.

So I was taking like science electives because at the time, science was an elective because girls didn't do science.

they couldn't call it an actual thing that everybody did. So we had to choose to take science classes or choose to take the higher level math classes.

So it was always me and 30 boys, basically for all of my science classes until I probably until junior high when America decided science was important for everybody.

So it was very much kind of like surrounded by, was the girl in boy classes, I was kind of the girl in boy classes.

clubs, but also very much a girl too. So kind of a, I'm very much like a middle line person in kind of all the realms of my life.

So I, although I, you know, dressed up like a girl or did my nails or whatever, I also tied my dress between my legs and my club trees.

So it was very much like this kind of interesting life where I got to be friends with almost everyone because I was a little bit of everything, if that makes sense, which kind of led me to be a popular person in school.

I mean, I think the five foot two thing doesn't help, you know, didn't hurt, but I think people were accepting of me because they could not.

And even to this day, I think everybody tries to box me and like figure out what I am, figure out what about ID.

But the reality is, I'm multifaceted, you know, I have like lots of interests, you know, would say I'm very masculine.

feminine, more or less. Although I think people always say, no way, because I look feminine, but like I really enjoy space.

like if you come in my room, there's a lot of kind of boy things, swords and things. So I think I throw people, and I think the reason I get a lot done is because people are constantly wanting to try to figure me out.

And yeah, I have good luck with that. So I think that's the groundwork of all of the things that I've ever done.

I mean, that's kind of behind everything, which is why I can be interested in web three and talk to people about writing on blockchain, but also be going to butterfly gardens.

So I think that I feel the world is very open to me, and that that has always been a part of my life, that I got to make a lot of different choices.

And no one ever really said no. You know, I spent a lot of time being a punk rocker. That was pretty fun, because I thought I was an anarchist, which you know, now I know that's not really an artist.

but it was fun at the time. But I didn't have, I don't have any, I don't have anger, but I do have masculine aggression.

And so like early on, I realized that I could have a lot of masculine aggression, probably like fifth grade, you know.

So I think I decided then that a way to outlet that was through punk rock. So I went to a lot of like mosh pits and like you'd see the little five foot two girl pushing boys.

And then I went away, I didn't have to be, you know, angry or aggressive. So I've really found outlets in the world for the things I tried to work through basically.

So I like even right now, I'm finding outlets to work through things that I'm learning about myself now. So I think that led me to really being, well, originally I was very interested in learning.

I really felt like, well, you know, think eight programs and blah, you know, blah, blah, blah, they do the test and they try to send you to mensa.

So like for a example, one year in fourth grade, Menza invited me to come and move to Utah and part of their program.

And at the same time, I was asked to be part of the junior miss, whatever, state, good looking girl competition, because I've been doing some modeling for the fashion show mall, basically.

so, they invited me to be part of this competition. And basically, I just said no to both. I was like, I don't want to go to Utah, because basically I saw the shirt that said eat, drink, be merry, because tomorrow you might be in Utah.

So to me, that was like, and didn't be fun. It's like, if they're making shirts about how unfun this place is, I didn't want to go there.

So I said no to Menza, and I said no to the beauty contest. And there you go. So I've done that a lot.

Actually, there's a look, I've had a lot of opportunities, you know, like I was supposed to be a rainbow girl, because my great great grandfather was a this or that and and said like a Mason heritage

And so I don't know. I think I've rejected everything that was organized. There you go. I've constantly rejected the organized because I felt like it keeps you from making your own decisions, I think, and it keeps you from seeing all the sides and you get boxed in.

So around the tables is always like, remember when Heidi didn't take any of the opportunities that were handed to her?

But you know, in doing that, I created a different life, right? it's been really good. So so then I went, we moved around.

My parents actually retired and decided to travel. So they got a motorhome like all white bread Americans do and stuffed me and my little dog in there and traveled around the country.

So back in time when I was like six for first grade. So I traveled the entire United States with my parents in motorhome for a year where she taught me the beginnings of my Montessori education.

and my mother did, and we went to every ghost town, every Indian reservation, went to all the powwows across the country, any ruin, anything that was destroyed or from antiquity, we visited, you know, if there was a scrawled picture of a deer on a wall and a cave somewhere, we were there.

So really got to kind of get a slice of America and people across the States, which is like even more different than Europe, if you ask me, because of the variety.

And even the languages, there's different languages. so, know, coming away from that, I had that too as well in my background as kind of an understanding of people.

So what I found was I felt like, as I was going into college and I graduated from high school, basically, I moved from Nevada, I had spent some time in Nevada going to school, their education system is so much better than California, when I came to California in ninth grade, California said, stop trying to go.

high school and go to college. So I went to college. I think I started at like 14 and a half, 15.

started at Butte Community College because I decided that I felt really uncomfortable with all the old people at the university.

It seemed a little too much. So I started at a junior college. And I went, I think I went for about one semester, and then I kind of freaked out.

was just like a lot. They put me in all these honors classes, which put me in places with 55 year olds returning to be real writers that had books and things they were doing.

And so I think I was really too young at that point. So I took about a year off and went back at, I think it was like 16 and finished my degree.

I got my AA, I went back to BU, got my AA. And at that time, I was thinking I would be a counselor.

I really felt like the thing our country needed was someone to help people, you know, to help people at the core, at the root, as opposed to like helping

thing I'm after the problems are created. So I decided education was a way to do that. And counseling, so I started taking those classes, at which point I found out that those were terrible.

Like not terrible in that of themselves, but very boxing. And I didn't particularly like the people I would be working with.

So I felt like they were not the fields for me. And at that point, I'd already been stalked and had like three stalkers in my life.

And I really realized that if I went into actual counseling, I probably would have a lot more stockers. So I didn't feel that was like a safe thing for me to do.

So I swapped it up and went into cognitive neurology, which I felt like, okay, now I can kind of, and I was really interested in cognition because of, I don't know, read some book, and I started doing exercises with my brain at about, I think, like 16 ish, 17, where I would put a metric.

I mean, I used to do just goofy things with myself. I was going to mention how my one corner turned the TV set on and then try to read a book and try to completely focus on one of them in a switching in between and being able to block out the other so they didn't interfere.

And so I realized like these kind of things could really help kids. Like I didn't quite understand why other kids could not easily learn.

I remember people being very mad at me because I was on a test. was like the straight A student.

But I also was like a stoner. So like people are like, how do you act like you do and have all this fun?

And then you just go in and 80s tests, you know, and like procrastination was my game, like writing the paper the day before.

So I was like felt really sad like that I had given this like up and not only did I have the leg up on being born to learn easily, but also then they throw me in these smart kid classes where they give me real education while everybody else is like in not getting.

You know, they're getting the average education and I think at that time I decided that's probably like 7th or 8th grade.

I decided that it's just really unfair system and so from that that's where I thought like how can I help everyone?

So I started doing the cognition I started doing studies on learning and memory and music because I realized the strong connection between music and learning So I was trying to create a program a Program not a app because of this time is like, you know pre all of that a program to to basically teach people to train their mind and Finding ways to utilize You know the ability to learn through music which which taps into both sides of your brain And you're and really your whole soul.

So because it's more meaningful and you don't realize it So I did all these studies on music and learning which actually, know, we're great, know plus or minus one hooray

Um, and actually one of my professors published it, I was very young and they published my, my, my, uh, my work.

Um, and I, yeah, I was super young at the time. It was like my first semester in actually university.

Um, and I went into honors and they basically published my study. Um, but still, you know, whatever, I was published and I was very excited about my PhD program.

Um, I was very interested in how the brain fills and gaps for us and how that is utilized again.

And people in our society and how people get trapped in those errors of, of thought, like, like, I think all of it actually started when someone told me to hold a piece of metal and touch a piece of wood and tell them which was warm and which was cold.

And that I found out I was completely wrong and that everything in that room was the same temperature, but it was drawing my heat.

Um, faster. And I was like, whoa, if I don't know this, like everyone should know these things. So. So I really geared all of my college towards finding ways to clue people in on themselves so that they didn't just run around bouncing into walls, crying all the time.

So, I decided to go to Chico State because it was where I was from. And I'd gone back to Chico to live because I loved it so much.

So I decided to go to Chico State, which at the time I didn't actually know that people were pretty prejudiced against schools.

I was busy doing other things besides one upping people. So I went to Chico State, I got my degree from Chico State and then wanted to go to Berkeley, obviously, because I had the best cognition department and neurology department and I was naive.

So I get this phone number. I don't even know how I got this phone number but in the old days you could just do enough research and get the right phone number.

So I got this phone number and I call it just to ask some questions like about my piece. the application and, you know, get some insight on it, and it turned out to be the head of the department, which basically doesn't ever talk to anybody.

You don't get to talk to him, which I found out on that phone call. So he lets me kind of tell him my questions.

And like, after about, you know, four minutes of me telling him my question, he said, you know who this is, right?

And I was like, you know, I read his name, he's like, you don't really get nobody gets to talk to me.

And I'm like, oh, I was like, you're the wizard of Oz. And we got to talking. And he basically told me they had never admitted a psych student from Chico State because psychology degree neurology is.

And I had not, I had neurology, so I had biology and psych, they never. And I was just like, that's ridiculous.

And he's like, and so basically they come by my desk, give it this Chico State, just I just don't take them.

And I just was just floored. So we have this big conversation about it. And then basically I was going away, like, I'm not even going to apply to Berkeley.

And he said, you know what, put your application. and consider it done. And so basically accepted me into Berkeley.

And then right before I started Berkeley, I got pregnant with a punk rocker. I got pregnant with one of my punk rockers, which was not in my cards.

I was never having children. I felt like my goal was to help other people's children. And, you know, that was not a place for my life for children.

But I also found out that as much as I want everybody to have freedom of choice, that it came to me, I didn't, I couldn't.

And so I did not make the choice. I thought I would and had a child. And then decided that going and working at Texas A&M, which is probably where, know, one of the places I would have ended up as a researcher, because there's very limited, you know, research positions in that field.

I didn't want to drag my kids away from the Bay Area. I loved the Bay Area. I'd moved to the Bay Area to Crockett, where my sister lived, because being

Being pregnant and Chica was really a drag Hot and everybody was having fun and I was and I was 27 up the time at this time And so no, guess I was 20 I must have been 25 or 26 when I got pregnant because I was starting a PhD and so I Just kind of went I Want I guess I've made this choice and I'm gonna have this family and like the PhD world didn't really I felt like mom I should be a mom at home Which it was an odd decision for somebody but at the time, but it was so then you know Unbeknownst to me well breastfeeding and on the only birth control pills you can take well breastfeeding I was able to get pregnant a second time So at that point I had two kids 15 months apart two babies 15 months apart and just the PhD was pretty well out So I stayed home with my children Until they were six and seven, but of course in between I was

like utterly bored. So, you know, there's only so much you can do with kids, they nap sometimes and things.

So I started doing really hard hobbies, like bonsai trees and saltwater reef tanks with no chemicals. And like doing all the scientific research on how to, how to create this micro system without any chemicals, because at the time, like everything was about chemical, like how could you put you could never put enough chemicals and anything.

So I started breeding, I started getting things from NOAA and their researchers. Like I started going on blogs and all these things and chatting up scientists.

And so they started sending me and things when they pulled stuff up. And I started breeding seaweed, which was, I was basically the first person in the saltwater industry in the Bay Area to start selling seaweed as a way to clean the water.

So I was kind of pretty popular and I had lots of people coming. I was like in this tiny little town in this tiny little shop with people coming from San Francisco to buy my seaweed.

And I was setting up these kind of cleaner reef tank packs that had all the nails and all the crabs that ate all the different things so that your tank didn't go bad.

you know, basically, you know, your life was taking care of it, right? You weren't doing it. My saltwater tanks didn't need to be really cleaned.

They were a clean system, just a quick water change, right? So it became really big. And I called my, so I started a shop because I could take my shop to the shop.

it was called Through the Looking Glass, a Living Art Studio. So everything that I did was custom. Everything that I sold was made out of nature.

It was either a bonsai tree or, you know, thing made out of nature in some way. And it was pretty popular.

And so then I got involved with an art alliance in Crockett and became part of their board and started really working with artists more than science and became the president of that board and started kind of running art festivals and things in the town.

and getting to know more artists in the Bay Area. And so that's kind of where my art world came in.

I would always done art and been artistic and like take in ballet and all of these things. taken a lot of things, but like never had been like consider myself an artist.

And so I started doing art and I started an artist cooperative in Crockett where in this old brothel, where I could still have my personal shop, but also have 15 other artists.

It had like little individual rooms. So that was lovely. And I got to be much involved in the art community and understand the value of art, I think, even in learning.

And so kind of this crossover in my mind was this art learning experience that I got from that. And then because I threw good festivals, they voted me President of the Chamber of Commerce.

So I was President of the Chamber of Commerce, I guess. I was pretty young. must have been 26 or 27 at this time.

So this all. kind of falling in line with the birth of children. And so, my 2006, I had been the chamber president for like four and a half years.

In fact, I had closed my shop because my children were older and did a different kind of thing. And I had decided to kind of focus on my family and my education.

I was thinking I would go back to school and get my PhD in something, which of course at that point, and like in all of this, there was this moment of AI, artificial intelligence, where when I graduated with honors, they immediately came to me and we're like, we want you to be part of this AI team.

We're looking for people with cognition, understanding of human nature and this whole thing with your music study. So they started to onboard me to be part of the AI universe, which I feel like I'm always like, all these stories make me sound like I'm so moral.

This is not right. the truth. I beared away from AI because I did not like, again, it was me and a bunch of boys, it was me and men, because we're talking like 80, 90, late 80s, early 90s, I started getting really interested in it.

So it was just very limited information. And girls really were not in those kind of techy fields yet. And mind you, the whole time I was a coder, like I had my first computer in 1970s.

I had the little box, Mac, and probably 74, five, when no one had them. Like, my mother was really into tech.

So she bought all these things. we were like, on the internet, when all you could do is do this thing called Peachtree and your business and like check the weather and the, you know, chats were starting to come about.

Like, I've always had tech in my life. And so AI seemed great. then like I said, I felt like,

the moral issues around what they were trying to do and what they were trying to have me bring in, I was like, I was not going to put the soul on a doll, you know what I mean?

So I stopped doing that and started going into the music and learning instead. So that was kind of the transition of that.

But then I had all this background. So like being able to run a chamber of commerce, it doesn't seem like you would need that.

But in a small town that didn't have emails when there were emails in the business world, like they really needed somebody that could guide them on how to create a web page and how to do their emails and do calendars and things.

I basically, I was like training an entire town, small town of business people, how to be business people. And it kind of given up on that whole neurological end of things and just started kind of going on the path of, I don't know, I mean, I guess the next, my next term was as the president

of the Crockett Community Service District, which we help form because in California when you're in an incorporated town, which means you have under 12,000 people, you can't be a city, which means every tax dollar you have goes to your incredibly inefficient county, and they can decide to care about your town or not.

know, they're not actually forced to spend the money on your town. So being the activist that I was and just sidelined my mother at 50 years old when I was 57, back to the university, got three degrees and a master's and took me to college with her the whole time.

So I actually had like this whole college experience at the age of seven, but she was a very big activist.

She was very liberal, like crazy liberal to the point where we would disagree really strongly because there was so liberal.

She was like a picketter. Like I would see my gray-haired mother on TV picketing Margaret Thatcher coming America and things like that.

So like, I had in me this like, if you want to make a difference, you have to actually make a difference.

So I helped form this Crockett Community Service District so that we could get the funds for board of five that lived within the town to actually rule, you know, make decisions for the town and create ordinances and things like that.

So I was actually on the ballot with Arnold Schwarzenegger for that. And I won as president. So I guess that is how I would have to live with that date whenever Arnold was on for governor.

I was on the other side for our little town and I won and I actually won over some very impressive people.

I, you know, again, popularity helps and throwing festivals helps. So I was on that board for four and a half years and kind of helped shape the creation of a town that takes care of itself.

So that was kind of great and kind of taught me about governance and how to solve problems for small town.

with no money. Sometimes it's not always popular, but it's a way to solve sanitary issues or things like that.

I feel like I changed that town. When I still work in the town as a watershed program manager, I go there and people are like, when are you moving back?

When are you going to make things right again? I see the things that I did there. I started a farmer's market in a town that had no food.

All of it was because I had kids. I wanted my kids to live in a nice town, add things to offer them, and had the fresh fruits and vegetables that I had when I was a kid, and had that sense of community.

So I spent a lot of time just helping build the town. And then I got a divorce from my children's father.

We'd been together 13 years, but you know. Oh, we were together when he was young. was like five years older than him.

And I guess we all hope everybody will grow up. But like when he got into his mid to late 30s, it did not feel like he was growing up.

And I just couldn't do it. So I sort of waited until my kids could just themselves and I could talk to them about it.

And we got a divorce. We still completely co-parenting and we're still friends, like we were friends after our divorce.

There was no, we had no divorce lawyers, we didn't go to court ever. Like we went to the office together inside the paperwork and we had no orders to who has what kid when we just worked together.

So like we still co-raised our children very much. So in fact, like even in the same year that we were divorced, I went and stayed the night at his house on Christmas Eve so that we could all get up and have Christmas Eve or Christmas day together.

So like, you know, I was still very much a mother-father situation. But it gave me, you know, the to kind of do other things.

So I decided like I have all, you know, I'll either go back to school and plus he was the breadwinner.

Like all of these positions I've talked about were of no pay. I was paid for none of them, not a dime ever any day.

I was doing like 60 hour week, you know, work weeks for no pay. So when he left, I obviously had to pay.

So I was looking for a job and one of the people that have been on my board worked at East Bay Mud and actually kind of sent me this article like, Hey, this conservation district is looking for someone.

And it's, you know, good pay wages and it's a great career and it's local. And you're doing, you know, all the good things that you were always doing for fun, you know, because I was kind of a volunteer environmental volunteer and activist.

So I was like, you know, I look at it like required a master's and natural resources or something. Most of the people at my job either have a master's or a PhD in some kind of natural sciences.

So I was like, I'm not getting this. And she's like, look, most of what it's asking for is to be connected politically and to know the town, because they were looking for people for Rodeo and Crockett, which had never had anybody coordinating for them at the RCD, at the Resource Conservation District.

So it was like a whole new first time around, needed somebody to build, you know, councils and committees and things.

And so from there, I went to that interview and she said, well, you know everybody, like, you know, I knew all the politicians, I knew the congressmen, hold on a second, I have a question from somebody that they're going to just keep calling.

Hold on. and animals biodiversity and all that. So like they basically hired me on the spot and I've now been there.

This will be my 18th year going on 18 years. Which is remarkable because like it's a great job. It's actually a pretty high-paid science job.

So to go from the belief of, I'm going to be this PhD independent person in science to go from that to being a mother and then just being like this queen volunteer and not knowing what I was going to do to like having just a wonderful career that allows me to work when I want, work from home if I want to.

So I still had a lot of time for my kids. I set my own schedule and like to this day I'm still doing that right.

So but in you know in the interim I also got very involved. I swear so. I also joined a punk rock band.

I joined a punk rock band called Mystic Knights of the Cobra. At some point, we actually toured with Green Day in New York City.

was about 12 years ago. So like as a grownup, I was doing that for fun. It was fun. And then got really very involved with the tech art industry in the Bay Area, going to all the underground parties and all these things.

And kind of just recreated, took everything that I'd ever learned and made it possible in my world all at once.

I have my farm. I have my venue. I had my punk rock band. had all these things that. But those are the main things.

It kind of led me to where I am now, which is I love water. So we were like about 10 years ago, we like, we're going to move to San Francisco, and we're going to get a little box, you know, the kids have moved out, going to get a little box, and I'm going to live in a small place in San Francisco and not have a car and do San Francisco things, because I can work from anywhere, really, in the bay, certainly.

And so we found this place out here in the Delta. We found this place out in the Delta. And my first thing was Mike, my co-farmer, co-person was, I said, know, this is, I'm not going out there.

It's like Hicks and like, Tweakers, terrible people, conservatives, terrible conservatives. Not the right kind, not fiscal conservatives, like crazy mean conservatives.

And he's like, let's just look at it. It's so affordable. So we drove all the way out here and it was just like a beautiful day.

and like the property was beautiful but destroyed, you know, it had been a square house. There's two little tiny houses on the property that needed a lot of work, a lot of garbage removal.

like for the price to have a place that we could come to when we lived in San Francisco and get away from the city seemed right, so we bought it.

And we had pulled up on a side note of how punk rock has has changed my life. When we pulled up to this property, on the side of the boat house was this big kind of transparent plastic sign, the black background and bright red letters, and it said Cobra.

And so like my band was the Mystic Knights of the Cobra. And I was like, well, clearly, you punk rock band.

the entire horn section. So basically it's a big theater event. It's has zero to do with music really to be honest with you.

It was much more about activism and and boas, pink boas with spikes. So I was like, oh, this is like our place.

We're meant to have this. So we buy the place and we start cleaning up. And so, you know, I find myself like caring less and less about going to San Francisco.

And so I kept my condo in Benesha. was living in Benesha at the time, which is like a really nice little kind of arty engineering architecture town across the bridge, the car chemistry.

And so I kept my condo. We just started cleaning up here. And like more and more, I was just like, how can I even not even be at my house anymore?

I really just want to be in the delta. So I would like get off work and drive really fast the delta so that I could drive really fast home.

So I could go to work the next day kind of thing. And then somebody gave me a chicken coop.

somebody's like, I have this chicken coop. I didn't have chickens, but I had a coop. In the middle, I dropped and Michael, Michael Farmer, had moved out here.

so he was living here. As soon as I put chickens in that chicken coop, you know, I was just like, I'm done.

I sold my condo. I moved out to the Delta and have been here ever since and started just expanding.

I got involved with Forbes Island because a couple of my friends knew about Forbes Island and knew that I was friends actually with the owner of the Marina that it was at.

So I called up my friend to look at this, this big, weird thing. And he had toured me and I was like, this is just amazing.

And at the time, I was very much still set up like a restaurant and it was just gorgeous. And then two years passed, and I wanted to have a birthday party, my birthday is October 29th.

So it's like a Halloween party. And Forbes was many, and did a conversation and I thought that could be fun.

So I went to talk to my friend and basically he had sold his marina a guy from Montana taken over the marina, did not like the riff-raff artists from Oakland and San Francisco literally told me hated queers, which that was not the word he is, that's like the nicest way to say what he said.

And that that island would never see a day when people could have a party on it. So I was like whoa okay and he's like I suggest you just talk to the owners and have a rogue party.

So I didn't know any of the owners at the time so I got the phone number the owners and I called them and I said hey you know what are the odds of me sneaking in on this property and having my birthday party and they're like well you know they've cut the gangway, you can't get to it, you won't let us park like there are all these levels of like calling the cops on them.

for being wearing funny clothing, you know, and very racist, man. Also, so I was like, but you know what?

If you wanted, it's yours for free. So he's like, but you got to get there by boat. So I put 125 people on boats and had a road birthday party very quietly and got away with it.

And so then, and I think like a couple days later, was cleaning up and the new owner, the Montana guy, came and you know, was like wearing cleaning wear and things.

And so I looked like like a real person, I guess, to him. And he's like, what are you doing there?

like, when it all the cops, because my friend had pink pants, no joke, the cops we were having a gay while we were cleaning.

So the police board, and I was just like, well, you know, we're cleaning, you're welcome to go downstairs. And the cops were just like, well, I don't think we're really needed here.

This is a lot, you know, so they leave. if. And so I decided to let this new owner scream at me, which he did.

And then I just started negotiating with him. And also, like, I was old, or, you know, this is like six years ago, says, oh, it was my 50th birthday and my 50th birthday there.

So I was 50 and he was maybe in his 50s. So I started kind of speaking the 50 year old language and like kind of, okay, I'd be like, what can we do to actually utilize this as a place where we can throw events again?

And he's like, well, if you're in charge of it, I'll let you do it. So called the board, you know, now I know the owners of this party invited them all.

So they all now know me, know me. And so they're like, are you kidding? He talked to you. And I was like, yeah, and they're like, you're our girl, like join the board.

So I joined the board and was able to kind of to start having parties again. I mean, it wasn't easy because he was just so hateful.

But I was having things like Halloween parties. So when he saw us. We were in costume and I don't think he really realized that like some of those people just wear those clothes all the time.

So at some point he saw me in festival wear and felt very betrayed. You know, he was like, I think he thought, you know, like I was a regular old Betsy Sue or whatever and, you know, conservative, you know, didn't approve of all these, you know, , as he said, but then when he saw who I really was, he was like, oh, this is a normal day.

And, you know, I don't know what I was wearing, but something colorful, probably, something festival and from there was just like, it was on, he was against us.

I could not get him to budge a little, you know, but at this point I'm so ingrained in loving Forbes Island and trying to help this board that, you know, I'm sticking with it, you know, we're going to figure out a way to move Forbes Island and get it somewhere better.

So we started talking about buying a marina. So this marina came up down the street from my. house and we bought that marina together.

So we're partners in that marina thinking that we could get Forbes Island there. And in between all of this, I had bought a cow that was supposed to be miniature.

But what I didn't realize is that sometimes miniatures only set 100 pounds because, you know, cows are like 14 or 12.

And so my little mini cow got to be 700 pounds and outgrew my property here. So it was like, either get rid of my lovely cattle that I had raised or we get property.

So in between all of this, we had bought this the property at Bradford Island, because again, affordable. And so I put my cow there and we bought like 35 other cows.

So we have now have a herd of cattle out on this cattle ranch, off-grid, you know, no way to drive there, but just a cattle ranch, right?

so it was halfway between the old marina and the new marina via tow. So Oh, we had already kind of plotted out the toe to Bradford Island as a stopping point.

And then we would start again and on the next tides and go to our marina of Bethel Island. But then I got wind that there were some very shallow spots along the way, and she's like nine foot draft, so she's deep underneath.

And so I had a survey done, like an actual legitimate survey done of the Delta. The route and there were places that were like two feet.

So like I had no knowledge of any of these kind of things before this. Like I was not a boater.

was not, I did not have a boat. You know, just liked water. It was not about like to swim and sit on rafts, you know, maybe kayaking, but like I was not into boating or any of that.

But like suddenly I was like in this realm of towing and things, and like toe boats and learning how to do ropes and you know, being on boats all the time.

And so I became this like kind of boaty person in the last five or so years. So now I'm very boaty, know, I own a tugboat like eight boats.

And we decided, hey, you know, we've already got this Bradford Island plotted out. It's not the ideal situation, but it's a situation, you know, in our friend store festivals.

So we can, you know, build it as this kind of safe zone where people can be whoever they want.

So we dragged it to my cattle ranch, put together a bunch of docks and here I am with a cattle ranch with, you know, campground and a venue.

So that's how that part, both that's how all of those parts of my life became kind of ingrained with the Marina purchase, the Marina.

So of course, we can't, I mean, we probably can't, we pay $25,000 to have it dredged, which I know we could do because I do permitting, you know, I could get permits.

But I sort of love it out at Bradford. So, you know, I think it was just a series of mishaps that led to something different.

now, you know, now the art community that we're working with is much larger. It's the art community that's being kind of booted out of Oakland and booted out of San Francisco being gentrified.

And they have nowhere to put their beautiful art pieces and they have nowhere to work. So, very much that's my art world went from like gallery stuff to giant art.

So I got very involved, obviously, with like a lot of the Burning Man people. But I really got involved with them more through the boating.

joined the washed up Yacht Club. And in joining the washed up Yacht Club, I met all the people who live on all the sailboats that live.

The boaters lifestyle. it's how I got involved in a femoral and how I got to. eat all the people that I know how I got to meet the sea stutters and how I got to meet the libertarians and how I got to meet the DJs the coolest DJs and the people who are on the clubs so I can just kind of snowballed really because kind of each step of the way has just been like one thing one mishap leading to another that led to where I am and so started helping organize a femoral because I'm crazy and because all of sudden I was really good with boats and and plotting things and understanding tides so started getting really involved in pulling all the big infrastructure out for a femoral and then once you do that you're just the queen of it because there's really no organizers it's like one of those we don't have insurance nobody talks about it nobody's organizing it so we all just kind of drag things out but I became a person with all the docs and all the things because I now had all these things so started telling things

out and became like the center position the largest island at ephemeral while the DJs and musicians and artists doing art and things like that and techies and NFTs and so where all the people give their lectures and workshops and things.

So I got to like know everyone like Jim Mason and I got to know you know Brewster and I got to know all these people because of you know it's kind of funny because like when I put it all together it doesn't amount to art like if you really if I made a list of the people you'd go what do you mean art you know this is tech this is you know spiritualism or this is this or that but like when it all gets down to it there's always one tiny little thread through all of it that brings everybody together and so kind of the interesting thing about ephemerile is that everybody sort of shins their hats and like and their gear and no one knows really who anybody is like nobody's going

I am Brewster and I did this. We're all talking about art projects and like how to get the floaty from an island to the next.

Like nobody's really discussing work. So what I didn't realize is like the leaders of the robot heart camp are on my island and leaders.

So the leaders of some of the largest burning man camps, long-standing Burning Man camps are on my island. And I got to know them over several years by doing hard labor with them and building and hammering and then like the first time I went to Burning Man after meeting all of these people was when I realized, oh, like all of you are like actually famous and you are all doing 200 foot middle sculptures that are just amazing and you're a genius.

like, you know, found out one of my best friends worked on Stephen Hawking's chair, doing the integration between neurology and technology.

You know, meanwhile, he, you know, like a mouse. I don't know. Anyway. like it has just dropped me in the middle of so many different universes.

I think for a while, there was this like off grid movement to make Heidi be the leader of the crazies.

But because I am not part of the burn it down culture, I really like they were trying to integrate me into their burn it down culture.

And I just refuse actually. So from that, I think I decided to take all of this stuff and create this decentralized autonomous organization, which is really how Maddie and I became friends.

I mean, went to this crazy thing where people told us we were the bridge to humanity, and gave us the first Hopi corn.

I don't know if at told you that story. But supposedly, Matt and I are part of the bridge to save all of humanity, according to the Hopis and apparently several other people.

It's very weird experience in Colorado. Ask him about that experience of thing where we were when we met. But I went away from that going, wow, like, what if all of this is true?

What if there is a place where I am supposed to be doing real good? Like, it seems like I've been trying to do that all my life.

And, you know, and not to say I haven't, like, I have people, I still get letters from kids that I helped, you know, things like that, you know, over the years.

But, like, real help, big help. So I, I thought how to do that. And my, my feeling, and I had, I had kind of made this DAWA prior to meeting Maddy.

Well, I hadn't kind of, I totally 100% of it. So I'd already kind of outlined, and I had already met my friend, Sean, who writes on the blockchain, and my sort of friend, not friend, John Connors, who is like the content extraordinaire who did hackathons, and was really connected in the web community.

So I got really into web three with these guys. And just the idea of a Hanuman stuff, you know, not being boxed.

So I decided I'd do this Dow around the around the idea. Well, and it also came from doing creek cleanups with communities.

So I throw these events where I do creek cleanups with communities. And you know, you'll have a houseless community under a bridge.

And like, people like, don't go talk to them, don't talk to them. You know, I can, I feel like that division, like, we clean up the mess and then they make them as and if we don't talk to each other, we're really not fixing anything.

then I, so I started calling like the local people that are supposed to help, you know, give help to the houseless community so that I could actually interface with them.

And then I, you know, go out with them and all they do is hand them some brochures. And I'm like, wow, you're expecting them to get there, have a phone, understand what you're telling them, read English, you know, that's like so many layers of expectation.

So I thought, you know, the problem with this is we're doing these isolated systems and not incorporating getting social workers and real change or education, getting them back into school or getting them into drug rehab.

so I thought, like, it's so interesting because it just made me think about people doing things they love, the passion of doing things they love.

And I thought, I'm going to gather people who love to be social workers, who love to help and who love to throw events or to to fix a creek bank or whatever.

And like, let's actually fix the system. Let's fix the creek, like, fix the neighborhoods around it. Let's help fix the problem of homelessness.

Let's, let's fix fix fix. You know, and I thought, stop, you can't do all these things. So, like, how do you go about doing that?

And I thought, well, you do it sort of like they used to, like, you'd have guilds, like, you know, you have your blacksmith and he learned from his father and he loves being a blacksmith.

you know, he does it because we love, you know, and I said, well, you know, what happened with that?

Why didn't the guilds work? You know, why people do what they want to do, what they're good at. Why did that not work?

And I thought, well, there were kings, okay, right, kings and taxes and all these things. So I thought this Dow was a really nice way to create, I was doing an umbrella.

Really, I was doing greater than one was what it's called, or was called, or it will be called. And the idea was that I would create this umbrella that would help people do granting, and help bring people together, and help do the organizing, and help do the launches.

But really, it would be these guilds that were doing their own Dow. So I started with the artists, and that's why I'm here with you.

But I mean, in my mind, I had scientists, I had social workers, I had everyone, I had everyone, right.

And they were all creating their own Dow, and then this top layer that I had invited Maddie to be part of, was the

Right? It's the one that looks at the problem and goes, okay, we're going to look at the headwaters of this creek.

What is wrong here? Who do we need? A hydrologist, a social worker, a cleanup crew, you know, the garbage man wants to be a garbage man, a recycler.

That lady who loves to recycle, you know, or wants to make art of it. And like, how do I start getting people to recognize that, hey, this is the thing you can do and you can tokenize it.

So instead of the garbage man that never wanted to be a garbage man, but always wanted to be a ballerina or whatever, being that garbage man, there are people out there that actually really enjoy things like that.

They enjoy that kind of labor. And I know they do because I've worked so many volunteer events and that's I know people love every good or bad job, you know, that everyone has their own potential.

And so it was my intention to start the artist one so that the artist could put the message. out in a way that everyone could understand because I feel that art is universal and that art can bring people together that would never get along.

And I also very much wanted to include people that I don't get along with, like the Montana guy, like we need those guys too, and we need everyone to have a part in it with their best skills, whatever his was, being angry.

don't know what this was. But like, instead of focusing on money, you focus on the outcome of what you love and where, how that fits into society, and the umbrella of the Dow would, oh my goodness, my son, the umbrella of the Dow would provide that help and that the artist would help me gather the guilds.

I don't pause there. You're almost done, so you're very lucky. One second. So yeah, so that's how mad and I met.

That's where I was. But quite unfortunately, John Connors was kind of a greedy soul. And he was also the one that kind of helped me get into the web three.

And he basically undermined all our efforts and destroyed her down. I mean, didn't destroy it, but I let it go because like anything started under that kind of negativity just felt wrong.

So I felt like I would. take a lot of time in between before I try it again and it just I've been so busy come up and also I'm not sure I like dows I don't know I mean he was able to undermine it so quickly.

Out of greed and like I you know I felt like dows didn't have loopholes but boy. It's like he found them pretty quick because he had done all these things to kind of make our artists angry and like picked on Matt and picked on my friend Jason who was on the board.

Because of greed I think he thought he could run them off the board and get more tokens for himself.

And it was starting to hurt my friends and maybe not Maddie but it certainly hurt the ego of my friend Jason.

And I didn't want to start that way you know. And so I thought about going and doing a different now like let's get the scientists together or let's get the techies together but I still very much think it's the art that starts it and starts the role.

Because it's the advertising you need right. to get other people to realize their potential and so then you guys came and mind you I have like a couple of LLCs and I have electric avenue and I'm involved in some other art projects that have have LLCs around them but but this to me this nonprofit is like as close to that art down you know this is the same idea as mine in a different way because mine is much more like a cross all all things which is just ridiculous actually and I've decided that's pretty big hope but it's the same idea like what can we provide to them where they're making money off of their efforts where they're doing what they love and they're making the money off their efforts and then they're spreading that love forward and they are actually making difference in the world and I'm still sort of working on this watershed idea because part of my plan was check

I'm always trying to break world systems. To make people recognize that watersheds are not outlined by some border around a county or a state or a country, that watersheds are a meridian line more than they are a region, and that if we were to work with France, south of France here in the Bay Area, they may have an understanding of the exact same things that we need information on.

So I was helping someone map all the watersheds of the world in a grid, meridian line by meridian line.

The idea was that the idea around my Dow was that we would start this core of people that understood Web3, like Mattie, and understood art and had been really driving art, and that when they were able to get together their Dow that worked so smoothly and beautifully, and it was working, that then part of the idea of the Dow was that they would go to the next county.

itty place and teach others how to do it too and that that dad would then reach back to Bay Area however many years it took to go around that meridian line and fill in all the gaps.

But of course I want to do that with like everything like the whole thing everything. And I still really love the mapping of the meridian line the watersheds as a meridian line but see we'll see if that happens.

I actually have someone still working on it that we started with the Dow. But yeah I think that that's why this opportunity I see this feeling very similar.

That idea of supporting people where they are and making it easy for them to sport each other. As opposed to all this competition we always feel like for example when I started my art studios in Crockett I literally had one of the other art galleries or several for a tiny town.

It's like three or four art galleries, you know, 3,300 people with four art galleries. And so they were very threatened by me coming in, this like young upstart, starting her art gallery, know, all her artists and windows and whatever.

And they did things like turned each other into the county. And I thought, you guys are this tiny little town and you spend all your time back stabbing each other instead of like creating a collective.

And so it gave me a real glimpse of of how disconnected even a tiny portion of people can be when they don't feel internally supported and how much angst and anger and wasted effort that took away from what they really were in love with, that they were defending.

Like they're defending, they're angry at me because I'm bringing an art gallery and they think I'll take their customers.

But really they're just living in fear of losing customers. And so I was just like, do a better job.

Or hey, let's do something together. And so I started doing like combined art gallery days, but it took a lot to break that down.

And so like, I know how hard that is. And so I think the way you're doing it for the artist piece is so nice.

Like it's just easier, I think, because you have... Ours was all sort of like talk, you know. It wasn't fleshed out.

It was a lot of concepts. I think I get pretty... Sometimes I get bogged down in concepts and then just like go of concepts.

So I think this is very nice space for me to be a worker that gets to be part of something that suppose was something I wanted to start, but didn't, you know.

It's another one of those men's of things. But also I think that all of those things, that rejection of that Dow idea, was because it wasn't right.

I was not ready for Or I didn't. I don't think I had enough understanding a web three at the time.

I certainly didn't know nearly what I do now about the communities. So, yeah, that's why I'm here, I think, Greg.

Even though I have all these things still in my life that are busy, I want I want to be part of something that's that is this kind of progress in our in our society because you don't see it very often.

And deep breaths. Did you have more questions, you just want my story?

It doesn't even make sense. No, that was brilliant. You ticked off most of the boxes on my list.

No, no, no, not at all. And, you know, I think I've been kind of whittling it down to what you haven't covered, and it's barely anything at this point.

So, just with the remaining time, I would love to like share my point of view, but this isn't about later.

Later, I would love to talk about all this stuff.

[@1:16:32](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4592.32) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Oh, my junk. I want you to know why Maddie even asked me to be part of this, too. I feel like, you know, because we haven't had one on one.

You don't know me, you know, so I felt like I want you to know me, so you know where I fit into.

[@1:16:47](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4607.06) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Yeah, well, thank you. And yeah, I mean, there's there's a greater vision, I think that we all share, too, that's beyond the creative.

Absolutely. Yeah, and I think, you know, On another call, I'll explain to you what I've been doing locally with another group to solve things at a more holistic level, resources and community.

[@1:17:12](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4632.38) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Yeah, I think you'd really like that. you know, Brian life, team is just amazing. He's very passionate about the same things.

And I really hope we can all, you know, just solve this little thing at the creative economy and then move on.

[@1:17:33](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4653.58) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

[@1:17:36](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4656.1) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

I think that interesting and, you know, my point to kind of sort of all of it to that point of that now and all of that was that, like, everyone appreciates art.

The people don't even know that they're that they don't know to be angry about it.

[@1:18:00](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4680.0) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

You know they're using all their childhood aid and anger and stuff against things because they're like, well, it's art It's okay, you know Yeah, and you know, there's you made some great points about people being scared because of scarcity or you know perceived scarcity And that's one of the things we need to inject is this feeling of abundance where you know Do you don't have to worry about fighting for your portion of the pie because there's just so much of it going around and that I think that's true is just impossible to see that when you're out looking out at the world Well, it's hard when you're trying to pay a lot for eggs.

Yeah, absolutely.

[@1:18:41](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4721.2) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Yeah, and that's why you need your own chicken goop How many eggs did you get a week? was like, I don't know too many and they're like And they're like, what do you do with them?

I'm like, do you sell them? You must make so much money I was like, no, I give them away and they're like what but like

Yeah, I give them away. It's a whole different universe. It's a whole different, you know, of abundance.

[@1:19:06](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4746.68) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Yeah, exactly. the few things that I have to circle back on are really just more for the focus of our grant opportunities.

And so it's more about like your experience with grant management and financial leadership and what you might have done to, you know, right grants in and how you've had that number as if that helps.

Yeah, that might be the best way to do it. just wanted to like make sure that was in there because I think that would be with a complete picture.

[@1:19:45](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4785.36) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

I've been writing grants for, well, know, gosh, forever, I've been writing, my first grant I wrote when I was 15 and working at View College for an after school program for kids.

So there you go. I've been writing grants since I was 15 years. This have received one million, about $1,800,000 in grants this year, for my agency.

[@1:20:24](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4824.6) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

That's great. And so a lot of what your experiences from this, the group that you've been working with for the last 16 years or so, is that right?

[@1:20:34](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4834.6) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

yeah, get them. Yeah, I'm So basically, right down to my pay, everything is either grants or contracts. So I, all of my restoration work is done with grants.

There is no like the RCD doesn't sell anything.

So, and it sounds like you have some understanding of what the grantors want in return.

[@1:21:11](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4871.64) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

have EPA grants and things like that. course they've all been. Now everybody's horrified, but yeah.

Yeah. And that's, I mean, on grants all week. I'm sure getting started.

[@1:21:50](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4910.1) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Yeah. And you know, it gets easier, honestly, because you have all those. I give your deck, right?

[@1:21:56](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4916.38) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

yeah.

[@1:21:58](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4918.2) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

And I, and I've been a grant manager. you're probably on about $20 million with the grants?

[@1:22:07](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4927.8) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

That's a good number to stick in there.

[@1:22:09](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4929.76) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Yeah. Yeah. I like the actual manager of them.

[@1:22:13](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4933.92) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

So how do you see the structure of that working? There's a manager who manages the grants and then they handle all of the accountability for the finances and getting the work done?

[@1:22:27](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=4947.0) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Well, here's how, yeah, sort of. mean, so for me as a grant manager, you're one that put your name on that grant.

They're going to only want one. They'll take your whole agency. So it'll say Contra Costa Resource Conservation District, but it'll say grant manager hypotenie.

So if anything really goes wrong, I'm sort of the first on the hook, right? So from there, I work with our, so you would work with your financial officer, which I guess we really don't have those yet, but whoever is doing all the finances.

hopefully that won't have to be just you. so you sort of set up this like nice workflow. I start by looking at the grant, looking at the budget so I know what I'm, you know, of getting in my mind what a budget might look like to know if that grant is enough money for what I'm asking for.

Because I think grantors want to know that you are wise enough to know it's not enough or it's be like you can $50,000 or more, right?

And some grants are like $1,500 or less. So being very realistic about what you can get from the grant and if you have a big enough grant to be a larger grant, right?

And then, you know, you write your grant, you get it, and then they'll send you all of the things they want from you, you know, like this is your horrible template for putting in invoices, and this is our terror and most of the time it's just like

this terrible workflow that makes zero sense to anybody and has a lot of red tape. Although maybe you'll be working for easier granting company agencies, I don't know, depending on where you're going.

So, you know, I mean, it would be that way with any kind of like state-run art fund. There's going to be just ridiculous amounts of silly paperwork.

So it's like my job to create all the folders with all of the templates, know, get the invoice to my account person, to my financial person, really go over what those invoice formats mean, you know, and how that translates to what she needs to output to it and what her part is.

So, like, kind of picking your team, because it's very hard to be a one-man team on a grant in a way, because you I think that's where errors come in.

So I think when you do your grant, The first thing you like a big one. So let's say you're doing a $50,000 grant and it's going to require you to really do like quarterly reports or whatever any of that like you as the person putting the proposal in and looking at the grant need to really go.

Okay, this is going to take in my mind this many hours like this is really this many hours a week to just manage this grant and make sure you can set that aside.

And if you can't make sure you've picked your team and everybody's agreed to their part of it and know what they're what they're in charge of.

Then you as the manager going. So you're going to be in charge of invoicing. Here's the invoice. Here is the calendar with the dates that these things are done.

Here's what I will prepare. I to you or what you will provide to me. So for example, one grant I have requires me to create an activity report for everything that we do for three months.

And that is like everything we do like I wrote emails or whatever. And so I made sure that on our time app, timesheet app, that everyone puts into their memo lines exactly what they did, right?

So that when I run those reports, it's easy for me to turn that into either a summary or a timeline list.

So I think really as a grant manager, just kind of figuring out how to make the team flow so that the output is exactly what your grantor work wants.

And that includes like calendaring everything, you know, like, for example, in order for me to do my memo line, what everybody did, because I'm

out there in a field with them doing their work on my grant, right, necessarily, because we do all kinds of different pieces of the grant.

So, like, I do the watershed stuff, they're doing the botany stuff, right? So, I set up all those things so that we can independently work, but we're independently working on our on my timeline.

So, I need Patty, my accountant to put together the hours list from all the staff that worked on my grant for three months, send that to me in a format.

And here, it seems like these things are really like self explanatory, but not necessarily like she started sending me, she would send me that as an output from QuickBooks and our time cards in a PDF format.

Well, I don't know if you've ever tried to, you know, look at a PDF format and act like it has a table in it, like that's just not real.

It turns into little tiny boxes when you try to edit it. can't grab things. So now I know to tell Patty to always output it as an XLS, and then when I get it, it's something that's usable for me.

I then take all of that, put it into the word format where it's the written summary and all of those things, and the timeline and lists that I send that back to her.

And she inputs that on page three of her invoice, right? like, some of the grants will be that specific, like your page three should be this heading and this thing.

So I think as a grant manager, you're just making sure everybody is doing their pieces correctly, right? And then you just put it all together as a package to send to the grant tool.

And that's really the so like it seems like it all when you're reading it, you'll go, Oh, okay, that's easy.

I can do that in voice or then and know, you know, oh, no problem. But you have to remember that that it will get really overwhelming.

to actually be producing the stuff that you're getting paid to do and producing the stuff that the grantor runs from you paperwork-wise.

So, you know, saying, okay, you know, Heidi, will you keep track of these receipts? I'm just going to throw my receipts up into the folder.

I'm not even going to organize the receipts. And then your job is to organize the receipts. Here's the form that, here's how you do it.

I'll check in on it, you know, and then you know that's getting and that's and then that gives you more room to do the actual project because like for me, not only am I grant manager, I am grant, I'm doing it, you know, I'm like boots on the ground, getting all the people, hiring the contractors, doing the RFPs, all of that stuff, like I'm doing all of it, right?

So, as you get the money, you want to be able to focus more on the job, the output, right?

And so, I guess, as my best suggestion, for anybody who's new to granting and larger grants is oh my goodness my son is calling me a lot is you make sure you don't think you can do it all and make sure right off the bat you pick the people to help you and and they have to be willing also hold on one second I just want to turn my phone you

You Oh, my gosh, I bought this part for his BMW and they won't take it back without using it.

I bought it for I like I bought it for him and they won't take it back. And these parts are so ridiculously expensive.

So it's like getting this rush to get the new part to make his BMW work.

It is what it driesicles.

[@1:32:03](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5523.16) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

And now I have to give the coast my card. I don't like that, but whatever.

[@1:32:08](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5528.08) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Now I have to change it.

[@1:32:09](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5529.5) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

I love it anyway. So yeah, I think that's like the key to it. Because I think I always think, ah, this is a piece of cake, you know, but those invoices come up so fast, you know, and like.

Just create lots of, I mean, I hate spreadsheets, but I also love spreadsheets, um, create a timeline with everybody on it, you know, like, like.

need to put my invoices in on the 15th of February. So from you, I'm going to need your list of receipts in order in this form by the fifth or whatever, you know, and just really giving yourself enough time to do the work and to do corrections, right?

On anything like, Oh, where's this receipt? why is this mouth not adding up? Um, and. That's what a real manager does, know, like really be the manager of it and set those guidelines.

And I think that it feels weird at first sometimes to be like that bossy person in a grandpa. Like end result is if you get somebody to raise their hand and say they'll do it on a grant, they really need to, right?

So there's that. Like, and I don't mind helping the grant stuff. I'm pretty good at it. Like receipts and boring things and pretty good at, if I have enough of a heads up, right?

That I, when it's due, I get things done. So if you do help, and I think, you know, having everybody edit everything and like relook over all the things before you send it in, like the things become so much easier as your grand tour realizes you're good at it.

There you become much more helpful. And I also think, ask a lot of questions of the grand tour. I think they want that.

I think they want you to engage them so that know you have enough information to do a good job.

I think that's pretty vital in getting grants.

[@1:34:06](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5646.86) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Yeah, great advice.

[@1:34:08](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5648.48) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Yeah, I always, and you'll almost always get, you know, who their manager is of that grant on that end, and just getting to know that person even just want to reach out with a real, real friendly smile, you know, an email, a very humble email asking questions.

They appreciate it.

[@1:34:28](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5668.9) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Yeah, can see that makes a lot of sense.

[@1:34:31](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5671.22) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Well, most people don't really do that, I think, and they're just like left in the limb. And then at the end, they're sort of angry.

It didn't work out. know, like, there's all these layers of hardship that can go with granting, and especially for a grant manager that's trying to manage on their end, the grant or manager trying to manage multiple people doing the grant, right?

Having that personal connection with them makes it so much easier because you can reach back and forth easily.

[@1:35:00](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5700.0) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Yeah, there's a bunch of contacts that I have in Boulder for the, I think, probably seven or so grantors or organizations that manage the grantors.

[@1:35:11](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5711.86) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Great.

my goal is in the next month to reach out to them all publicly and try to reach the talk with them.

[@1:35:20](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5720.36) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Yeah. And even if it's an email, just so that they know your name and know that you're being thoughtful.

[@1:35:25](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5725.98) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Yeah. Yeah, good stuff.

[@1:35:28](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5728.6) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Yeah, I think money sometimes makes people, I feel like a lot of people taking grants are sort of arrogant.

Like my thing is the best and I deserve it.

[@1:35:36](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5736.1) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

But like everyone thinks that and they, so letting them know that your humble matters. Got it. Yeah. Well, I'm full of the humbleness, that's for sure.

You are, you are humbleness.

[@1:35:47](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5747.2) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

You're very good at being humble.

[@1:35:48](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5748.58) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

So, and your emails are very polite.

[@1:35:52](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5752.24) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

I think being polite is very important because they have to work with you for the extended period of time, you know.

So that, I mean, I do think. But to be honest, I think a lot of the grant managers pick me because they're like, oh, she's easy to work with.

And she writes emails back very quickly, you know, they're not left in the lima lot.

[@1:36:10](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5770.92) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

So great. Well, we can wrap it up here.

[@1:36:15](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5775.66) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

It sounds like you covered everything.

[@1:36:18](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5778.82) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

I was going to finish with your vision of the future. You did kind of outline that already.

[@1:36:25](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5785.42) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

We captured it all. So thank you so much. I want to see this become a thing for all things.

This idea to be a kind of thing, just having everyone be internally supported so that they can externally support you know.

[@1:36:40](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5800.54) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Yeah, that's my fear.

[@1:36:42](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5802.5) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

Whatever I can do. Or you know, I plant this hobby corn that he gave me. And we just changed the world that way.

I was like, think this is like, this is a rip-off Yeah, that might have been a metaphor or a metaphor.

I don't think so now actually it really wasn't oddly Greg. It was like it was like this is the very first Ear of corn by the gods of the Hopi given to us to give to you when you arrived.

That's what he said Wow, and he said plant it Take the kernels off and find the people that will work with you to make that bridge for humanity I was like oh my goodness.

I have to go home I literally said he's like and I want you to come back to Colorado soon and see me and I was just like I can't I And I yeah, I literally was like I can't you know, maybe that's wrong Matty never planted his corn interestingly enough and I feel like you may have lost I might have to give him a new kernel But it is an interesting thing to be told I'll tell you so So it's not what you're with that because I met him what year before last

I guess, well, he came to a femoral year before, so it must have been two and a half, three years ago.

[@1:38:07](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5887.08) - **Grig Bilham (grigbilham@gmail.com)**

Oh, and at our age, that's fairly recent.

[@1:38:10](https://fathom.video/share/n5fsyF-5bf5zxJLfiLcYrN8ysZhbq-xn?timestamp=5890.24) - **Heidi Petty CCRCD**

It's really recent, yeah, like really recent, and you know, it's sort of an interesting thing because like, I'm going to say I was conned into it, I was told I was going to give a speech to other heroes of watersheds and activists of water to talk about basically about projects, right?

to do water projects? How to get people to let you do them and things like that? So I had this big speech and it apparently, and like, everybody was, and I flew there, which is odd because I never flew it, fly anywhere in winter, it's cold, I just don't do that.

But I felt really compelled to go, and then I got there and it was like, huh, this is weird, this is not science, this is not about

a watersheds. This is about aliens and healing. I mean, not aliens, but sort of like, it happened, there were Buddhists, there were people from Nepal, there were people from like all of these different spiritual sects, saying that we were there for a reason.

And like, I thought was there just to give a speed. And like, I remember sitting next to Matty and like, starting to be like, these people are kind of freaks.

Like, I didn't know what we were doing. They start saying things we have this ancient alien sound vibration thing, know, and things like that.

like, I'm not not into that, but I'm also like skeptical of that as well. I mean, I feel like it is very healing where I'm from the shoulder of Orion or not, I don't know, which is what they said.

But there was a bit of that there. And then there was like, again, there were like the Daoists and things, the Buddhists and things.

And so, like after like five of them said kind of a similar thing to us, it started kind of freaking me out.

I was like, was this set up and like, I'm the only one that didn't know. That's what we were doing here, you know, like, you know, I like, I remember like, poke and Maddie and go, did you know it was going to be like this?

You know, that's kind of stuff. And he's like, nope, I'm just getting stoned.

And Maddie was one. So here we are.
