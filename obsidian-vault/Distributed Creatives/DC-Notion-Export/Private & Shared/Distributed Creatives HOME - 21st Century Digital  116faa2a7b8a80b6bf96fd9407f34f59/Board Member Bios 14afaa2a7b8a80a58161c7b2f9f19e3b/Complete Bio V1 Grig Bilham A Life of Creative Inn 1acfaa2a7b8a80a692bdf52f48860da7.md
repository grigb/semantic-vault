Over a 25-year career spanning multiple disciplines, he has consistently bridged the gap between creativity and technology, developing revolutionary platforms that have transformed how artists create, distribute, and monetize their work. His lifelong commitment to balancing both hemispheres of the brain—the analytical and the creative—has produced a unique perspective that informs his current mission of building a more equitable, sustainable future for creators worldwide.

## Early Life and Formative Influences

Grig's journey into the world of technology and music began in childhood, shaped by parents who recognized and encouraged his natural inclinations. His father, an accordion player with a deep appreciation for technology's potential, purchased one of the earliest personal computers—a Mac 256—when Grig was still in junior high school. This early exposure to computing sparked what would become a lifelong passion for exploring the boundaries of digital tools and systems.

His formal musical training began at age seven after attending a bluegrass concert that sparked his fascination with the fiddle. His parents, recognizing this passion, arranged for him to study with a private violin tutor from Juilliard during their time living in New York. Over the next five years, Grig's dedication to the instrument led him to the position of second chair in the Boulder Youth Symphony and participation in a quartet that performed throughout Boulder, Colorado. This early immersion in classical music developed not only his technical skills but also a deep understanding of musical structure and theory that would later inform his electronic music endeavors.

As he entered adolescence, Grig's musical interests expanded into electronic music, though resources were limited at that time. Discovering Kraftwerk became a pivotal moment, introducing him to new sonic possibilities that existed beyond traditional instruments. This discovery led to countless days spent in music stores, exploring every available recording and absorbing diverse musical influences that would eventually inform his own creative output.

## Musical Evolution and the San Francisco Scene

Grig's musical journey continued through high school, where he formed several small electronic bands inspired by industrial acts like Nine Inch Nails and Skinny Puppy. Simultaneously, he began his earliest solo electronic music productions under the moniker "Neuronaut," a project he has continued to develop for approximately 35 years. During his final years of high school, he formed a band with his brother and friends that would remain active for nearly two decades, blending their shared appreciation for 1970s rock influences like The Doors, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, and Eric Clapton with emerging electronic sounds.

This period saw Grig and his bandmates deeply engage with music theory, seeking out professional jazz musician teachers to expand their understanding. Grig began studying under Art Lande, an acclaimed pianist, jazz artist, and drummer based in Boulder. This jazz training profoundly influenced his approach to composition, providing insights into form, intervals, and the deliberate use of dissonance that continue to inform his musical work today.

In 2000, seeking broader opportunities, Grig and his band relocated to San Francisco to embed themselves in the vibrant electronic music scene. Their strategic approach included purchasing a professional-grade sound system, which they leveraged to secure early performances by offering both musical entertainment and sound equipment for events. This resourceful approach established their presence in the Bay Area underground scene, where Grig would become an influential figure.

For approximately 20 years, Grig was deeply immersed in the San Francisco Bay Area's underground electronic music culture. As "Neuronaut," he performed regularly at outdoor festivals and club events, while also managing sound systems for large gatherings. His electronic compositions gained significant recognition, earning him slots at major festivals alongside artists who would later achieve international prominence, such as Tipper, Bassnectar, and Glitch Mob.

## Philosophical Journey and Spiritual Exploration

Parallel to his musical and technological development, Grig embarked on a profound philosophical journey that has shaped his worldview and approach to creative work. His extensive travels have been instrumental in this evolution, offering perspectives on human experience beyond the American context. In India, where he spent two months, he collaborated with a professor to interpret Sanskrit texts and locate ancient temple sites, discovering that they formed a pattern mirroring the Ganges River when mapped. This experience, along with visits to Nepal, Fiji, Mexico, and extensive travel throughout North America and Europe, impressed upon him both the relative privilege of American life and the universal threads connecting human creativity across cultures.

His time in India was particularly transformative, involving visits to Bodhgaya, where Buddha attained enlightenment, and participation in the Mahakumbh Mela, a major pilgrimage and festival of faith. During this journey, a conversation with a spiritual leader revealed the universal importance of the golden rule—"do unto others as you would have done unto yourself"—across diverse spiritual traditions, a principle that continues to guide Grig's approach to business and community building.

The Boulder area offered Grig meaningful connections with significant counter-cultural figures. He developed a friendship with ethnobotanist and philosopher Terence McKenna, collaborating on art pieces and website development. Similar creative partnerships formed with visionary artist Robert Venosa and his partner Martina Hoffmann. In California, Grig met spiritual teacher Ram Dass, whose acknowledgment of Grig's ability to discuss spiritual matters meaningfully affirmed his developing philosophical framework.

Grig's reading has been equally expansive, encompassing works by Terence McKenna, Alan Watts, Eckhart Tolle, and various Stoic philosophers. These intellectual explorations helped him navigate the often chaotic energy of San Francisco's cultural landscape while maintaining his authentic optimism and open-heartedness. He found particular resonance in Stoicism's emphasis on recognizing life's brevity as a catalyst for meaningful action and service to others. This philosophical grounding has informed his approach to technology and business, viewing both as potential vehicles for positive social change rather than mere profit-generating mechanisms.

## Addictech: Revolutionizing Digital Music Distribution

In 2004, the same year Apple released the iPod, Grig co-founded Addictech, a pioneering digital music platform that would transform how electronic musicians distributed their work and connected with audiences. Recognizing the inequities in existing distribution models, he built Addictech with a revolutionary approach: returning 70-80% of sales revenue directly to artists, establishing a creator-first business model years before such concepts became mainstream discussions in the technology industry.

The platform's success was immediate and substantial. Within just 16 months, Addictech had distributed $2 million to electronic musicians, demonstrating both the viability of more equitable compensation models and Grig's technical ability to implement complex systems at scale. As both founder and CTO, Grig personally handled all aspects of the platform's development and operation, from coding the autonomous cloud-based service for music publishing to managing AWS integration, transaction processing, and scaling infrastructure to meet growing demand.

Addictech was among the earliest businesses to utilize Amazon Web Services, implementing S3 cloud storage in 2006 and later expanding to EC2 instances and eventually Lambda functions. This early cloud adoption positioned the platform at the technological forefront while allowing it to scale efficiently to serve a growing global audience. Grig's technical foresight extended to offering lossless audio downloads well before this became standard practice, prioritizing audio quality when most platforms were focused solely on compression and convenience.

Beyond its distribution capabilities, Addictech evolved to include a sophisticated music discovery system. Grig developed a unique approach where expert curators thoroughly listened to each track, tagging them with detailed attributes. This metadata powered a remarkably accurate recommendation engine that helped users discover new music aligned with their specific preferences. This curatorial approach, combining human expertise with algorithmic recommendations, created what Grig considers a superior music discovery experience compared to many contemporary streaming platforms.

The success of the platform led to the establishment of Addictech Records, which published approximately 100 releases for artists including E-Prom, Lawgivers, Audio Void, Brand Richards, Vent, OPU, Bird of Prey, Casantila, Side Bag, The Fruit Bat, Digital Rust, AMB, Spoon Bill, Fine Cut Bodies, Griff, Ivank, Bill Bless, and Bog Trotter. Many of these artists remain influential figures in the electronic music landscape today, their careers significantly advanced through their association with Addictech's innovative platform.

For 16 years, Addictech remained a cornerstone of the electronic music community, only concluding when Grig sold the business in 2018 to pursue new ventures. The platform's longevity and success stand as testament to both the technical robustness of Grig's implementation and the ethical soundness of its artist-first business model—a model that has informed his subsequent work with Distributed Creatives and continues to influence his vision for more equitable creative economies.
