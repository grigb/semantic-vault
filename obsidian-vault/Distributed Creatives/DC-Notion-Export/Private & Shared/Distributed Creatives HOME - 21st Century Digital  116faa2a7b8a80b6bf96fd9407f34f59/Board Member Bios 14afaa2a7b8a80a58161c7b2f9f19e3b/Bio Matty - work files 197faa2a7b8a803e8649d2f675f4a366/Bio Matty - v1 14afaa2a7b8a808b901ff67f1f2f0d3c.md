    My role at ARISE the first 2 years was as an official poetry coordinator. Those years I brought groups of poets to perform on the pirate stage at StarWater cafe and as wandering performers out around the festival grounds. The first year I brought 10 poets one of which was Anne Waldman who is one of the founders of Naropa’s Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics and was close friends with Allen Ginsberg. The poets would perform during set changes and provide another flavor of artistic expression to add to multidimensionality of the festival. As the event grew they no longer offered tickets for poets to perform and so the amount of poets dwindled as the years went on. As I move forward with my personal brand and growth of the media company it’s my goal to get poetry integrated into all the festivals just as live painting has been.  Eventually my vision is to have poetry integrated into live music events year around at the majority of venues. I see this happening by making a cultural movement around it and getting people used to it.
    
    Dank PHART the Pirate Poet is a Beatnik, prankster at heart on a mission as a digital renegade lunatic birthed upon this plane to help reveal the lock pick to the garden gates that lies within us all as entry to our freedom. As a warrior of light and dark he’s a rainbow tornado of literary liberation here to blow the doors of perception wide open revealing the universal connection in all things. As a Pirate Poet he calls forth a new vision for the planet that designs it’s systems from a reflection upon the organic patterns that will achieve abundance for the whole ecosystem. His work is much more than just his own poetry and brand in addition he supports art community wherever he goes to help facilitate a more thriving world of artists expressing themselves authentically.  A rEvolutionary with dreams of a tomorrow that leaves the children’s, children a beautiful planet to thrive, dance, and sing upon.
    
    *A warrior of light and dark*. *Rainbow tornado of liberation* beyond sexuality, gender, species, planet into union with all creation through recognition of organic patterns that underlie constructs of reality. When the world is under influence of a powerful individual it’s the gravest responsibility of the individual not to abuse that power. When the world is your oyster no to the self becomes the most powerful word in one's vocabulary. No doors need be locked for fear of intrusion from a person of true power. Source of power not of him but through him. He is a Mortal vessel that is merely a channel for great WORK to prosper. Pungent odor of creations mavin plant cannabis emits from very soul. Plays outside lines yet builds bridges for all of society to join him on the other side being mindful to include some gentle paths for those that aren’t yet ready to shaken from their slumber
    
    DANK PHART The Pirate Poet A.K.A Matty Bovard is a community organizer and cultural instigator based in Boulder, CO.  Growing up in Fairfield, IA, a small rural farm town that is also the epicenter of Transcendental Meditation in the U.S., he was exposed to many different world views. This cosmopolitan experience reflects deeply in his work and he walks his path as an artist to help heal the broken wounds among nations so we can all rise together as the ancient rainbow tribe of all colors, creeds and orientations. He studied theater and English at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, IA.  In 2009 he graduated with a B.A. in theater and a minor in English. In 2011 he moved to Boulder, CO where he’s been ever since organizing local community art events and working the regional music festivals while developing a sustainable poetry brand.
    
    During the development of Knew rEvolution, the company that was a precursor to this and provided the first exploration of the ideas I bring to the table, I did a year of internet radio broadcasts. From November 2011- February 2023 I broadcast 4 hours every other Sunday. It consisted of 2 hours of original music and 2 hours of talk radio. I produced 1 hour of music that was sourced from my community and the 2nd hour was produced by a friend who lived in Boulder for a brief period but moved back to New Orleans. Her show was all original music from her community in New Orleans, which was an urban black community. The talk radio had a variety of content from alternative medicine, artist interviews, psychedelic philosophy, water and it’s vast aspects, alien phenomenology. It was pretty much an open channel to let people talk about interesting things. There were a number of shows that were episodes  from shows that my friends put on for their own brands. For this work I was collaborating with Buddha Bomb and broadcasting out of the studio in north Boulder. This was to prove the concept and never really developed an audience but learned a lot. I stopped broadcasting after Buddha Bomb passed on his 72nd birthday.
