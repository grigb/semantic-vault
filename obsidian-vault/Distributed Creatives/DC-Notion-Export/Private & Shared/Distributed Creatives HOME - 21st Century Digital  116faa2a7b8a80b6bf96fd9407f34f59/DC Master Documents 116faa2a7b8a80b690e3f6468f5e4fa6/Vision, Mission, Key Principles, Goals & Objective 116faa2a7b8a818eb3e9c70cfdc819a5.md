# Vision, Mission, Key Principles, Goals & Objectives

### Vision Statement

A non-profit organization dedicated to developing the digital infrastructure necessary for a thriving 21st-century art economy. We envision an art world where creativity and artistic expression are nurtured as public goods rather than commercial enterprises. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies and fostering community-driven initiatives, we aim to create a more liberated, equitable, and creative world.

### Mission Statement

Our mission is to build and support a global, open, non-commercial digital infrastructure that empowers artists, fosters creativity, and enhances community engagement. We believe that practicing creativity is essential for individual well-being, community cohesion, and innovative problem-solving across all sectors.

### Key Principles

1. **Creativity as Essential for Health**
    - Engaging in creative activities is vital for mental, emotional, and physical well-being. By promoting and facilitating artistic expression, we contribute to healthier and happier communities.
2. **Art as a Community Instigator**
    - Art has the power to bring people together, foster dialogue, and build stronger communities. We support initiatives that use art to address social issues and create inclusive, vibrant public spaces.
3. **Creativity for Problem-Solving**
    - Creativity is a crucial skill for solving complex problems across all sectors. By cultivating artistic practices, we enhance individuals' and organizations' ability to think outside the box and innovate.
4. **Revolutionizing the Art Industry with Blockchain**
    - Blockchain technology is transforming the art industry, offering a global art market that operates 24/7. This decentralized system provides transparency, security, and accessibility, empowering artists to reach wider audiences without intermediaries.
    - Using the power of decentralized tools like Blockchain and forever-storage solutions, we can build an evergreen creative economy, and leverage the global community.
5. **Art Liberated from Commercial Constraints**
    - With an open, non-commercial infrastructure, art can be liberated to be whatever it wants to be. Artists can create without the pressure of commercial viability, leading to more diverse and authentic artistic expressions.
6. **Economic Empowerment for Artists**
    - Our infrastructure allows artists to make a living from their work without middlepeople extracting value from their efforts. This direct support system ensures that artists retain control and receive fair compensation for their creations.
7. **A More Creative and Liberated World**
    - A world that values and nurtures creativity is a liberated world. By supporting artistic endeavors, we contribute to a society that values innovation, diversity, and freedom of expression.
8. **The Artist Industrial Complex**
    - We envision the rise of the Artist Industrial Complex, where art replaces the Military Industrial Complex as a key driver of economic growth and social progress. Art, as a top 10 economic sector, should be recognized as a public good rather than a commercial enterprise.
9. **Art as an Economic Backbone**
    - Art should be an economic backbone, not an extractive industry. By investing in and supporting the arts, we create sustainable economic growth that benefits everyone, fostering a more equitable and resilient economy.
10. **Anti-Corporate Control**
- For too long, the dominators in the industry have controlled content and profit distribution. We aim to flip the script, by building venues that aren't controlled by a monopoly business model, like is seen in the event space. We will create a new network controlled by the creatives and accessed through public resources and small businesses.

### Goals and Objectives

1. **Develop Digital Infrastructure**
    - Build and maintain a global, open-source digital infrastructure that supports artists and their work, enabling them to connect with audiences, collaborate with peers, and access resources.
2. **Incorporate Blockchain Integration**
    - Facilitate the integration of blockchain technology in the art industry to ensure transparency, security, and accessibility for artists and collectors.
3. **Foster Creative Education**
    - Develop and support educational programs that cultivate creativity and artistic skills, preparing individuals to thrive in a rapidly changing world.
