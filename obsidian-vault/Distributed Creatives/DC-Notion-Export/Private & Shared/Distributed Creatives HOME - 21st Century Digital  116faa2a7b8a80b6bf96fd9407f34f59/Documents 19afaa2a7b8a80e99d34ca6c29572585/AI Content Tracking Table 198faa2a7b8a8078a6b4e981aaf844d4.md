# **Purpose**

To provide a simple and clear tracking table at the top of every document, ensuring transparency on AI involvement and approval status across different platforms.

# Notion Template Usage

Notion provides a built-in template for AI content tracking. Here's how to use it:

## Template Fields

- **AI Use**: Indicate how AI was used in the document:
    - None - No AI involvement
    - Partial - AI used for specific components
    - Full - AI heavily involved in creation
- **AI Edit Status**: Select the appropriate status of AI editing:
    - Not Edited - No AI editing has been performed
    - Partially Edited - Some sections edited by AI
    - Fully Edited - Entire document edited by AI

## Instructions for Use in Notion

1. Start each new document by filling out the tracking table at the top
2. Select the appropriate AI Edit Status based on how AI tools were used to edit the content
3. Choose the AI Use status to reflect the level of AI involvement in content creation
4. Update the status fields whenever changes are made using AI tools
5. Ensure the tracking table is complete before marking the document as final

# Google Docs Implementation

For Google Docs, create a simple table at the top of each document with the following structure:

| AI Use | [None/Partial/Full] |
| --- | --- |
| AI Edit Status | [Not Edited/Partially/Fully] |
| Last Updated | [Date] |
| Reviewed By | [Name] |

## Google Docs Best Practices

- Place the tracking table at the very top of the document
- Use Comments feature to document specific AI-assisted changes
- Create a template document with the table pre-formatted
- Use Version History to track major AI-related changes

## Universal Best Practices

- Keep the tracking table updated in real-time as you work
- Be transparent about the level of AI involvement
- Document any significant AI-assisted changes in the document history
- Review the AI status fields during the document approval process
