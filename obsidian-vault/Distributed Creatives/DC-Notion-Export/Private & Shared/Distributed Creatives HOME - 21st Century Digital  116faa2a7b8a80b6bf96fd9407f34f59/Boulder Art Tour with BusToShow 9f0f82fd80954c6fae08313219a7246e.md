### **How It Works**

1. **Scheduled Art Tours**:
    
    BusToShow will operate on set days (e.g., twice a month), offering curated routes to key art sectors of Boulder. Stops might include:
    
    - Pearl Street galleries and street art.
    - East Boulder Creative District.
    - North Boulder Arts District (NoBo).
    - Pop-up exhibitions, artist studios, and performance venues.
2. **Community Collaboration**:
    
    Distributed Creatives plans to partner with local cultural organizations, inviting their input, participation, and support to make the initiative a shared community project. Organizations can co-sponsor, suggest routes, or provide programming, creating a sense of collective ownership.
    
3. **Sponsorship Model**:
    - Local businesses, cultural organizations, and philanthropic donors can sponsor the rides.
    - Sponsors will cover costs like gas, driver wages, and maintenance, ensuring rides remain affordable—or entirely free.
    - In return, sponsors receive prominent branding on the bus, social media shoutouts, and recognition during the tours.
4. **Engaging Experiences on Board**:
    - Live performances (e.g., acoustic sets, poetry readings) by local artists.
    - Interactive guides sharing the history and highlights of Boulder’s art scene.
    - Digital art displays or videos showcasing featured artists.
5. **Accessibility & Affordability**:
    - Ticket prices low cost preferably free with sponsorship support
    - Long-term goal: Offer entirely free rides funded through sponsorships.
