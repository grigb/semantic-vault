# Outreach letter to Create Boulder

Dear Create Boulder,

We’re an arts non-profit that is being developed here in Boulder, CO. The mission of the project is to develop the digital infrastructure for a 21st century art economy as a public good vs a commercial enterprise. To this end we’re developing a platform that can work as a nexus point for independent creative culture to be empowered from the bottom up. 

Distributed Creatives includes five core projects:

1. The LAN (local artists network): This aims to create a digital overlay of real world art economies to network and enable commerce between artists, art enthusiasts and art related businesses. We will be launching our beta version for this right here in Boulder. Once the model is perfected it will develop nodes around the rest of CO and in time the globe. 
2. **The Metaverse**:   We  will explore ways to establish standards, foster community, and build an artists' economy in the virtual world.
3. **The Chain of Creators**: A cutting-edge NFT technology that enables each layer of digital content to be made into its own NFT. This allows it to be remixed with any other NFT while tracking intellectual property and paying artists royalties for usage.
4. **The Show**: A variety show that interviews artists and is broadcast online and via digital signage installed by Distributed Creatives at venues throughout the town. This signage and show become a social glue that weaves the living art economy together. Each node in the LAN will have it’s own version that can be streamed by any venue in the network connecting the nodes in global lattice of interdependent art scenes.
5. **The Fediverse**: The cutting-edge of social networking that distributes content across platforms built with the same digital infrastructure. This allows artists to bring their audiences with them across platforms. No longer being constrained to a single platform that owns your audience. 

We would love to connect your organization and discuss how we can be mutually supportive of each other in empowering the Boulder art scene to be it’s fullest potential.

Peace and Love
Matty Bovard, Co-Founder Distributed Creatives
