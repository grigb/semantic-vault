# Go/ no go metrics

Initial thoughts

- Budget - amount by what date?

For the budget that I put together our base cost is $10,270 Food and ferry expenses will be known as ticket sales come in and be included in the cost of the ticket. 

- Promotion - online promo posts where, by when?

I’m thinking most of the ticket sales will be coming from direct connections and we won’t be doing a bunch of outward promotion. Am open to discussion about good places to for promotion. 

If we do them I would want them to be ready to be live along when the tickets go live. Will probably need to do them a couple of different times.

Heidi is looking into a press release for the local area.

- Tickets - sales ready by when?

Beginning of March. This depends mostly on how quickly we can get the presenters confirmed.

- Tickets - amount sold by when?

I think having enough ticket sales to cover expenses by end of April is a good target. Having done some math that would be roughly 13 sales at $500 and 12 at $300 range.
