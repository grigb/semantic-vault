## **Logistics & Getting There**

Because Forbes Island is off-grid, we have several travel options to ensure your journey is easy, scenic, and organized:

1. **Ferry from the Mainland**
    - A small public ferry for cars connects Bradford Island to the nearest mainland landing. The ride is short—about 5 minutes—but it runs on a strict schedule.
    - We will provide **scheduled departure times** and a sign-up form to help you choose a convenient ferry slot. After docking on Bradford Island, it’s a short drive or walk to Forbes Island’s entrance.
2. **Boat Shuttles from Starboard Marina**
    - For a more flexible and scenic route, you can opt for direct boat transportation from a private marina. The ride takes about 45–60 minutes, offering a beautiful tour of the Delta region.
    - We will send out **online sign-up forms** to reserve a seat on the shuttle boat, ensuring a coordinated arrival time that meets your schedule.
3. **Lodging on Forbes Island or the Adjacent Farmland**
    - Several lodging options are available:
        - **Camping** on the farmland for a rustic outdoor experience.
        - **Bunk-style berths** on the 60-ft Army boat, for those who prefer not to camp.
        - A few **on-island bedrooms** (limited availability).
    - We will coordinate accommodations in advance to ensure a smooth stay.
4. **What to Bring**
    - **Weather-Appropriate Clothing**: Temperatures can vary, and evenings can get cool by the water.
    - **Comfortable Footwear**: Ground may be uneven on the island or campground.
    - **Headlamp or Lantern**: Off-grid conditions mean limited lighting in some areas after dark.
