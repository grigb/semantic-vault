# eARTh pARTy Conference Description

Our world is caught at the crossroads. Technofudalisim or Technoganic Cultural rEvolution. We gather here to declare that the future of humanity will be one of prosperity for all and not just our human relations but all our relations. This conference is a call to dream in a future where technology is our companion and not our government nanny making sure the workers get to their shifts on time. 

We believe that our future is so bright that we need wielding goggles and the best of humanity has hardly been tapped. The pieces for our future are already there we just need to be courageous and adventurous enough to dare to re-imagine how they all fit together. This conference brings together some of the brightest minds in creative culture, tech, regeneration and governance to boldly dream of what’s possible.

This conference is a keystone program for Distributed Creatives, a non-profit with a mission to develop the digital infrastructure for a 21st century creative economy as a public good vs a commercial enterprise. It will be a yearly gathering to continue the development of humanity and it’s fullest creative potential.

Join us for this inaugural conference that will be etched in the imagination of this planet for millennia to come. There will only be one first eARTh pARTy Conference. Were you there?

Creative rEvolution or Bust!!
