# eARTh pARTy Conference - Matty, Heidi, Grig-transcript

00:00:00:00 - 00:00:28:24
Unknown
And I am envisioning it that it becomes like a conference. So like basically like nonprofit organizations run conferences about the kind of ideas and works that they want to do in the world. I've been kicking around the idea of calling it the Earth Party Conference. With an emphasis on art and each of the words so small e, small first letter and last letter of both of the words with capital art.

00:00:29:01 - 00:01:01:20
Unknown
So our art, earth art party, and it be focused on, you know, building new systems and models of a better tomorrow for all. And yeah, using art as a vehicle for that. And like, voluntary art revolution is kind of my mission and ethos. And I, for today, really figure it out. Like with it makes like what it would take to make this happen.

00:01:01:20 - 00:01:40:09
Unknown
And as the the giveth project and like so like realistic numbers and various different things and, you know, if we really have that an audience to sell enough of these to make it happen and make it worthwhile. I do believe that once we if we get some traction and some sales, that it will make it easier for us to get more sales and it will attract other people from communities so that when people they potentially share what we're doing or they come across it and giveth, if they see some traction already gained, that it will gain more traction.

00:01:41:01 - 00:02:30:04
Unknown
Yeah. Cool. Yeah. So from what I understand, there is a, a cost to get things started, like powering the the island, and obviously standard cost for running an event, staff, etc.. And we'll need a group of people who are dedicated to planning for it and making it happen. But if we started with, funding from a crypto platform, that might be the way to give it wings, because, as, as we've discovered, I think we're going to find our source of money first from those, because we're still waiting on the five and one C3.

00:02:30:04 - 00:02:54:03
Unknown
And grants are going to be trickier, but there's money in crypto right now. So I could really see that working if we if we structure it properly and tell the right story on the on the giveth or maybe multiple places, to get the money together. Yeah. Because there are multiple there's also a platform called Juicebox that is also run on Ethereum.

00:02:54:03 - 00:03:12:08
Unknown
And it's got some tokenized mechanics. And I was just thinking though, that like we do we want to spread our and if we have like multiple campaigns, are we spreading ourselves too thin? Does it make more sense to just be like, this is the campaign and this is what we're just like drilling in, especially if they're on the same blockchain?

00:03:12:10 - 00:03:47:05
Unknown
That's my question. But I also agree that the crypto community is the community to be that tapping into. And I was thinking I was thinking like a $200 like ticket to the event. And that would be but then whatever, a little bit of contribution on on top that would go to the organization. And, you know, I was thinking ideally, like we could get a budget of like ten K to really just make this happen, to cover all the costs and some food for people and get a pair of solves a little bit to, to you're saying time for you to run it.

00:03:47:07 - 00:04:08:10
Unknown
People get get paid. Is that real the word that's the goal. We're working on making it real. You know, and just teasing. Yeah yeah yeah. You get paid in hugs remember like pretty much you want to know what that literally is what I get paid. And Greg I love from my community. That is the truth which is honestly the best deal, the best value there is.

00:04:08:10 - 00:04:32:22
Unknown
I really 100% agree. But today in the holiday season, paying is nice. Yeah, well, it's like we're going to create a world of like abundance where people like are grateful to pay and it should be part of like the flowing ecosystem, you know, and I have to say on that, that, my community is, is of the type that is more grateful to pay even, you know, even if you ask them for nothing, they often donate.

00:04:32:22 - 00:04:55:18
Unknown
So, yeah, those are the people that we like. Like that's the like our initial, like kind of community of like close like if there were like circles of, like networks and connections like this is kind of our first bubble of community that we need ones that are like super into what we're doing and also have a little bit of resources that they would be grateful to put into that way.

00:04:55:18 - 00:05:14:06
Unknown
So we have like a solid foundation to kind of move from. And as we continue to grow and, you know, put out our quarterly reports, that shows what we're doing, it gets them excited, even more. But then we have the like, you know, then the next circle is our like first core foundation of like users that become like die hard fans.

00:05:14:08 - 00:05:40:23
Unknown
And if we can. Develop those too and like really build those relationships on our platform properly and like, you know, with the solid foundation will be unstoppable. Yes. So I'm, I'm assuming this is going to be under the umbrella of Distributed Creative. So we're we're making we're building awareness of the, organization. And yeah, that's what I kind of like.

00:05:40:23 - 00:06:03:10
Unknown
It's like around with like transforming culture and the planet through like systems design and art. So like, that's where like how the models of distributed creatives and I like it kind of has governance at like a local level and like community stake and like all of those things are built in kind of like this new ethos that we're like pushing towards on for the planet.

00:06:03:12 - 00:06:37:13
Unknown
So there, for example. Oh boy. That's big. Yeah. There are a couple of things I'd love to hear, from Heidi about. One is some numbers, on cost and like number of people that can actually attend, right. You know, infrastructure complexities. And then the other half of it is this audit. Yeah. And the other half is like the audience and what they would be interested in attending and what's really going to turn them on.

00:06:37:19 - 00:06:57:13
Unknown
So that we can position it properly. Yeah, I did I don't know if that note actually happened. I mean, I wrote it, you know, I did see it, earlier and then, I was like, I'm not sure where you want. I'm, I'm still kind of trying to figure out where you want to think, but I figured if if I write it out, you'll find the right place for it.

00:06:57:13 - 00:07:21:00
Unknown
You guys got to embrace it and move it. Yeah. I just want to make sure I was making some notes in there. So, you know, like, basic operational costs are about, you know, for the, for a weekend, $1,200 or so because what that includes is quite unfortunately, 4 to $800 in a pump out of our clothing tank.

00:07:21:00 - 00:07:42:15
Unknown
So basically does your going right down the toilet. Which is unfortunate. But I have yet to find a way to. And maybe by the time we have the event, I'll find a way to be around that. Composting is very hard because, you know, nobody really lives there. So, and it's like, after we run the event, nobody wants to be the guy that shovels it.

00:07:42:15 - 00:08:04:15
Unknown
So it's pretty jobs. At this point to get that to happen and to get it legitimate, I mean, that's really it. It's about being legitimate. And I have a large cow. So, who knows? I'll work on that. I, you know, I have big dreams of having planted gardens that float, you know, that an island that takes that have low end and all of that.

00:08:04:15 - 00:08:31:10
Unknown
But that is possibly a little much of a reach for us. So I'm thinking about 1200. We pay Chris, who is our caretaker, to be there, set up, turn on all the power. You know, man the ship as a to say, you know, go behind people and kind of pick up a little bit. So but we only pay him $200 a day, so and we can technically do Chris's job.

00:08:31:16 - 00:08:54:04
Unknown
So that could cut costs by not requiring Chris to be there for the weekend. Because, you know, I mostly know how to do all the things. You know, I've been doing it a while. I just it's always nice to have a point person for that. So if I'm able to be that point person, or I can get my harbor master to be that point person, well, we're there, then that cost goes away.

00:08:56:02 - 00:09:18:01
Unknown
And like I said, if it's in a summer sunny month, you know, Electric Avenue will run that whole island until about 2 a.m.. That's pretty good. You know? And that's with the DJ. So that's a lot of power, you know, working for us right now. I, you know, we're we're looking at pretty much generators. We're not you know, we're not banking any sunshine.

00:09:18:07 - 00:09:44:04
Unknown
So that's rough. So really I think that is something I kind of to be discussed as to when we do it and if that matters. But when we had a party that had about 100 people, you know, and the power needs are the same, I guess for 100 people are more. And as last, but, it cost us about and that is what we ran to while I, me as well.

00:09:44:04 - 00:10:08:04
Unknown
So two generators, one for the island and then one for my army boat where people sleep. But, presumably if the army boat's in use, that means you're making money off renting bunk beds to people who want to not have to camp. Right. So you can rent that, and that'll offset that because there's about 500 and fuel to run that really heavy DJ party.

00:10:08:14 - 00:10:34:01
Unknown
For the whole weekend. So I think it was like we actually got there Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Yeah. So, depending on our timeline on that, that adjusts obviously. So sunshine, this is a sunshiny days are better for us as far as cost. Other costs are water. So, it's about 15 bucks, five gallon jug.

00:10:34:03 - 00:11:02:20
Unknown
So I recommend. Yeah, 3 to 4. So, you know, 75, let's say 70, 75. In water. That's not the actual accurate number, but I think I just ran in and don't feel like doing math properly. But so under $100, and then let's see any other and I'll pass. The, cleaning. So either we clean and we clean like we're made service at the end and beginning, or we pay some money.

00:11:03:00 - 00:11:40:00
Unknown
So I always for my parties, I clean, you know, I just I have my last set of friends stay as long as they can. And when we finally, recuperated on Sunday, we clean until three. And that seems to be able to do it. So, otherwise that's between 250 and 300. So that being said, it's about you know, at the minimum, 1900 or so for the weekend at the maximum, like 1514 and because I'm not charging, we're not charging, Forbes Island fees.

00:11:40:02 - 00:12:01:04
Unknown
What I'm hoping is if we make enough money, we will also understand that this is a venue that's suffering greatly by the economy. And we would donate back to us. But, I'm going to utilize this as one of my free events for the year. So, that saves us $5,000 or more. So. Yeah, I'll thank you. Definitely.

00:12:01:08 - 00:12:23:19
Unknown
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good group of all of them. I would say minimally, let's say 1200 is what I'm really at on reality. Yeah I'm putting 1500. Yeah. You should. Yeah yeah yeah. We want to do this right. And you know I feel really I mean, I don't know if I'm, you know, I feel like I, like I said, I charge like something like $200.

00:12:23:21 - 00:12:45:24
Unknown
Yeah. And then, I think with like a $300 potentially like contribution to the organization. So like a $500, like essentially a contribution. And then you get to this ticket that also goes to the event. And then what is that like, you know, you get like 30 people and you start to kind of what is it 30 times 200?

00:12:45:24 - 00:13:08:22
Unknown
Like I start doing math pretty quick. I'm like 200 now. Math is easy. I have already coming in like that much better. I have the sense that like either just make up a larger number or yeah, you know, we get to like start to even like and I mean, I just, I really feel like we that want to have at least like 30 people realistically to like feel like it's got like some good energy to it.

00:13:08:22 - 00:13:30:01
Unknown
But I mean, ideally like, you know, 125 would be like, would be my goal would be to sell this fucking thing out and like, get everybody there and just like, so fucking stoked and excited that they're just like, oh my God. Well, what did he Max occupancy, you know, have I reached it yet? I mean, let people, like, get a little soul.

00:13:30:18 - 00:13:54:08
Unknown
If we are using the campground, I'd say you could easily have between 150 and 200 people. Campground. I think it camp right on land. Yeah. So we have Forbes Island here. Let me, let me see if I can pop up. Let's see if we're on the map. Yeah, I think they've. I think I've seen some drones flying over and following our location.

00:13:54:08 - 00:14:30:12
Unknown
Let's see. We'll but they're using drones for, Google Maps or something out in the Delta. Yeah. Oh, cool. Like, ranch. Is that what's going on in Jersey? Yeah. Right. Because it's so hard, you can't get to any of the places with a car. So in order to really map any of these levee roads that have things to do with ferry systems and stuff, you know, sending people on this ferry ride or even even sending just an automated car, you're wasting like three hours, you know, because the round trip is you can't just get on and get off.

00:14:30:12 - 00:14:45:06
Unknown
Right. So yeah, some of the delta is so inaccessible but also somehow drivable. And it's strange. Okay, let's see if I can put this.

00:14:45:08 - 00:15:12:18
Unknown
Oh, there's. Because I feel like we're online, like cool people. Okay, let's see directions. That's funny. It's funny seeing my cows on Google Maps. Can you count them? Yeah, there's only a few of them, but they're cute ones. Okay. If I can see seamlessly. So. Maddie, operational cost of 1500. Yeah. How much do you think were.

00:15:12:21 - 00:15:38:12
Unknown
At what point does this start making sense financially? Or is this even a is the goal to be making money or just to, spread awareness and get the goals to raise to for the give it campaign to make like some fucking serious money? Like if we got like, let's see like because 30 people, like 300, right.

00:15:38:14 - 00:15:57:12
Unknown
And so and if it's only, we'd have like, we'd like make like about if 30 people did this and it was like a $500 like rate where like 200 of it's going to support the event. Which is actually would give us a huge fucking budget for the event. Yeah. Like I may say, if it's only 30 people, then it's one pump out.

00:15:57:12 - 00:16:21:19
Unknown
So it's half, we can clean it ourselves. 30 is super easy, you know, to go through and clean. So all of some of those fees will be less. The only thing that doesn't become less is the power, right? Because you still need the same amount of lights. Yeah. So I mean, I feel like that should be like that would be kind of my goal would be, you know, like, I guess like 30 to like, you know, 120.

00:16:21:21 - 00:16:50:24
Unknown
But I guess the question then is like, I feel like Hades, your community's the community that will really be like our core, like initial, like target that. Okay, what do you feel like the numbers that we'd be able to pull if we put together really like Fantastic Proposal. You know, it's so hard to tell these days. I'm getting between, like, 50 and 80, but also my events are just like, there's no not no point to it, but it's just like, come party, you know?

00:16:50:24 - 00:17:11:22
Unknown
So I'm like my Halloween party or my birthday, because people but now more people have been there, right. So we've had quite a few events now and people are going away and talking about it. This is we we didn't start renting it at Bradford until May just to let you know. So like it is just now and it sounds so insurmountable.

00:17:11:22 - 00:17:32:22
Unknown
Like if you tell people like and you have to get these ferry tickets and there's a ferry and all these things, but now a lot of them have done it. So they're, they're like, oh, it's worth it. You know, it's not as hard down. So I'm going to guess easily 30, easily 30. And if we sell the program enough it's like 100.

00:17:32:22 - 00:18:00:12
Unknown
How about that. That sounds that's I mean that's on it. That's what I was looking for because I think there will be some people from my community in Greg's community that are tapped in and just that making sure that for me, that the biggest just making sure we have enough of like a, you know, good numbers that we can like be like realistically tapping into, because I think we can put together a really amazing pitch and a really amazing, campaign on giveth.

00:18:00:14 - 00:18:24:05
Unknown
And I think we didn't do this till, like, like May, that will also give us lots of time with the I hope that it kind of takes off. And just like January, everything's fucking sold. But you know, also giving us like three and a half months to really just push it to. Yeah, I agree that to me like a little that.

00:18:24:07 - 00:18:47:19
Unknown
Okay. April May sounds a little, doesn't sound like much time to me. Yeah, I agree, I just I would honestly, I would go later if I were you because then you'll have sunshine and. Yes. And, they want to come as it's really going to make me quit and reopen. I forgot I got a brand new computer, so I have to quit zoom and reopen.

00:18:47:19 - 00:19:22:10
Unknown
Actually, why don't you, Greg, instead of me, then? Or whoever can, whoever can share, just go to Google Maps and look up Willow Grove Ranch and share that. Okay. And it's will ranch, Bradford Island. Cool. And I'm all all support of giving us more time. Yeah, I think we'd have more sunshine. You have more daylight. You have people swimming and enjoying nature and like, oh, yeah, we want to.

00:19:22:10 - 00:19:58:08
Unknown
People want our people to be able to swim. And I and April may still cold, so like. And the the first viable month is June, which is booked in the last weekend right now, the 28th, 29th, 30th. But that is a lot of our crowd. There's my cows law. There's a lot of that crowd that we could have a poster up on the wall and invite from that crowd, but I would say it behooves us to have it after that event.

00:19:58:08 - 00:20:20:23
Unknown
It's just, you know, have you met Joe? Be the DJ? I don't know if he was there that, you know, but that sounds great. Those are the exact kind of things that we're, like, looking for to tap into. Exactly. So I would say, you know, July, even if you had it on Sam always trying to, like, make people come from a female because they're all there on boats.

00:20:21:13 - 00:20:53:22
Unknown
So it's not a terrible plan to host it even, like during the pre week of a female so that people can boat over to from like all of us organizers who out there the week before could come. Yeah. When is that? Would it be too much for the organizers of ephemeral to be doing that? Well, then getting ready for ephemeral, you can me really, Matty, you know, I mean, it's, you know, and I don't want to I don't want you to, like, burn yourself out, even though I know you're superhuman and it's summer.

00:20:54:03 - 00:21:22:18
Unknown
And there's that. The real problem is August then brings Burning Man and, everybody is gone. Like, the entire crew is gone. And after a MRO, they're working crazily on billion dollar projects or not billion dollars, but hundred thousand dollar projects, you know? So, they're not making tiny things. They're the ones that make the big sculptures so that are 500ft tall or 200ft tall, so, yeah, I don't know.

00:21:22:18 - 00:21:50:04
Unknown
I mean, I've thought about it before. People stop by Forbes Island, on their own without me there, which is never knowing, that, you know, we all do field trips. We do do field trips ahead of time around which you can schedule during ephemeral. So you can put yourself on schedule to take everybody on a couple boats and go on a nice boat ride over to Forbes Island.

00:21:50:21 - 00:22:11:10
Unknown
This is nuts. The detail on this isn't that cool. So that's Forbes on my docs, right? This this is this leaves the doc right now. Yeah, but it's okay. Hey. The bed if you if you want to spend 40,000, we can just drag it over to a simmer. I'll make this party. You can. We can drag that whole island if I'm wrong.

00:22:11:11 - 00:22:33:10
Unknown
That's next year. Yeah. Seems out of budget. I can see my giant army boat there. And for size that 60ft, this thing. Yeah, that's a 60ft army, but it's like a Arctic avenue either way. Electric avenue, electric avenue. So that's our source. It's pre army about the Army. But guys on the outside there and it's as big as.

00:22:33:10 - 00:22:58:09
Unknown
Yeah there's film like late June early July is what feels. So you see there now is not there. This is pre actually pre us bringing bringing the army boat guy to have insurance crane barges there. We have use of that if we have a use for it. So like Moore is a giant crane barge. It's a giant just like adult playground.

00:22:58:10 - 00:23:28:17
Unknown
Yeah it's in China doll. Great playground. So what you do is then if you go across the way, to the land side, see the pond area with a ring, Willow trees. Oh, that's my mind. So back out a little and you can use that as our border. So the edge of that pond, all right. Going all the way back to where that square corner is, you can kind of see there's our dirt road, see up in, very.

00:23:28:17 - 00:23:54:13
Unknown
Yeah. That's that's the that's the boundary of our land. And then it goes like a pizza all the way to the front. So we camp. So this is a levee road. So basically you just walk up, walk over the levee road and you're in the campground. We camp in this very first five acres, which is pretty flat. This is like a, it looks like a dry summer.

00:23:55:09 - 00:24:16:01
Unknown
So yeah, we camp in that whole zone there that you're kind of looking right at. Yeah, yeah. The campground cool. And I it's awesome. I bought porta potties so we don't have that expense, which is amazing. We actually on them. So that'll be another fun thing we get to deal with. And, Yeah, it's always a event production to.

00:24:16:06 - 00:24:35:02
Unknown
Are people going to. I'm like, do you really have to go the bathroom? Can you? Anyways, but we did put in some low flow toilets. So I think actually all things will be a little more affordable. On that end. We put in like one gallon toilet. So cool beef. Because it was hooked up to a sewer system prior to this, so.

00:24:35:04 - 00:24:57:00
Unknown
Oh, wow. So what people have also been doing if you want to zoom way into the Forbes Island. So see the long dock you walk down. So there's like the go back at oh, and that's the boat lock dock. But let's see the walkway. There's the walking dock and you go all the way over. Just move it up a little bit more, okay.

00:24:57:02 - 00:25:29:00
Unknown
And that's our people. Aren't you there? Oh, the people on tour and people on tour. And that's Chris's boat where he lives. That's our caretaker. Our lives part time. But if you see this flat space here by the tree, it's kind of brown. Yeah, yeah, that that'll park, like, ten cars. But at the last two events, they got a food vendor and vendors there and have spaces, and you can buy shirts with their logo and things like that in there.

00:25:29:00 - 00:25:52:20
Unknown
Yeah. Food vendors set up and it was awesome. All they did was do their pop up tent and and blam! So that's another opportunity we could use. You know, get a local person I don't know or we or something. We figure out some food or, you know, we charge them the car. I mean, generally when I have a festival, I charge people to come.

00:25:52:22 - 00:26:12:19
Unknown
I'm not sure we'll be able to do that yet. With a new venue like this, you know, they're a little more skeptical, but it is a nice way to provide food. For what we could do is work out a deal where we get a percentage of sales. Yeah. I mean, I think that's worth definitely asking. And then they get to come to the event for free also.

00:26:12:19 - 00:26:49:01
Unknown
So and yeah, people that are interested in the event and also seating people are great. The conference. Yeah. Yeah I think it works. That's the kind of the idea is that this becomes like our yearly kind of think tank and it becomes a gravitational field of the best of the best minds and thinkers outside of the box, and also at some point becomes a place that attracts major funding for projects to get off the ground, so becomes like a launchpad for building a better future.

00:26:49:07 - 00:27:20:09
Unknown
Absolutely. And so I'm in this group called I forget what they called it, and we're we're awesome organizers or something. I don't know, because it's like all the secret underground Cacophony Society folks said, you know, John Law and all those guys. So if I can pitch it to those guys that are doing like the book club stuff in the, underground circuit stuff, and they come, they will bring the people.

00:27:20:09 - 00:27:41:05
Unknown
So I think the idea is if we can get a good pitch together early enough that I can get some of these organizers also into it, and also announce in that organizers group that we're doing it and the date. Right. So, yeah. And if there's any of them that like we'd maybe I'd like to invite them to present, if they have that.

00:27:41:07 - 00:28:07:03
Unknown
Yes. If we had some kind of roundtable. So what they've been doing is called Culture Club. And once a month they invite the boldest and stupidest in the Bay area. Hey, Colorado. Oh. Wait. The, the smartest and brightest in the gang, and San Francisco and Oakland that hosted large events like large, large events. So, yeah, we want them to.

00:28:07:03 - 00:28:27:10
Unknown
So and if we gave them space to speak, which is, of course, would all of them love. Cool. We'll give it to them. Yeah. Then I can pitch it as something that's theirs too, right? Yeah. And with their culture club, with new, new minds, and presenting what they're doing, you know exactly what we want. That's exactly what we want.

00:28:27:11 - 00:28:54:24
Unknown
That's the way to go. And because I'm in, like, the private signal chats with all of them, I can easily post that within the signal chat and start a conversation. Cool. Yeah, we can get I'd like to have the pitch ready by the end of the year. Yeah, yeah. I think if we start pitching, you know, January, early February, you know, or at least to start talking, have some kind of, agenda that I can put in there, flier or whatever.

00:28:55:10 - 00:29:31:05
Unknown
That that will give us ample time for people to find ways to participate. Yeah. And I'd like. Yeah. Because ideally, like, we'd be launching our give Us campaign, by February. Okay. So that we have this ready for each Denver. Yes. There's a huge potential that we could get like 10 or 15 people just to buy tickets from me, meeting me and Greg and Ethan, having QR codes and just give it is like give it is probably going to be there as a doing a bunch of different things.

00:29:31:21 - 00:29:56:17
Unknown
Denver. Beautiful. And what when when is that exactly? Maybe it's the end of last week of February into the first week of March. If you are able to come out here, it is free. And we can figure I can you can probably crash in my spare bedroom. Okay. All right. All right. Yeah, I certainly can see what my February's like.

00:29:56:17 - 00:30:18:14
Unknown
Okay, cool. Yeah, just let us know, because we can definitely figure out, a place for you to stay. And the event is free. Yeah. And I think it's this year. It's focused on regeneration, so it's, like, really all lined up with this. What do you think? The name of the Earth Party conference. Okay. Yeah. Why don't you send me those dates or send a candle account?

00:30:18:14 - 00:30:40:22
Unknown
Even better, send a calendar invite to me with those dates. Cool. And info. And I'll see what I can do about February. Ever so ridiculous. Now I'm just angry about it. Honestly. I can go to Europe for the cost of flying to Colorado. It just makes me like, yeah, like I'm just going to Colorado, people. I don't end up in Spain.

00:30:40:22 - 00:31:00:11
Unknown
What is going on? But I could, you know, surf tickets that way, too. Yeah. Yeah. There's definitely. Yeah. Cool. Well, I yeah, I'll send you a calendar environment, figure it out, figure it out if I can't. Because if I can come and boost it, I will, you know. Yeah, I think there's could be even opportunities just beyond this I there's it.

00:31:00:12 - 00:31:22:18
Unknown
Denver is like the world's biggest Ethereum conference on the planet. And Denver is just an epicenter of a lot of epic things. And so that there's and this year is focused on regeneration. And it being the bull market, it's going to just be absolutely fucking nuts. Like who like Bitcoin might be like 120 K like type of shit.

00:31:22:20 - 00:31:41:20
Unknown
And if that's the case people are just going to be losing their fucking minds. I know I got some email the other day that said and we'll give you all free Bitcoin. I'm like liar I like this. Yeah. Three whole bitcoin you were talking about. This is like a plastic thing and it's just a joke because no I'm not I don't know what this is.

00:31:43:02 - 00:32:07:17
Unknown
All right. So yeah let's I think that that timeline is really good too I for so I'm thinking like with Charlie and Dark and the folks that are really running the the Culture Club events and the underground events that it would be like giving them a free ticket, you know. So I'll give you four main leaders and free ticket bring people.

00:32:07:19 - 00:32:24:24
Unknown
Right? Yeah, exactly. And legs come up and even like probably consult to consult with them about dates that would work for them. So we get them. So we have to pitch together by the end of the month. And then we get them talking about it and interested in it. And then we go, what are dates that would work for you?

00:32:24:24 - 00:32:46:02
Unknown
Here's what we're looking at. I would really love to have you come. I can I certainly could invite Chicken John, who brings his own tribe and if given the opportunity to speak, will show up, and has his own thing to pitch with his farm and his art project going in the Delta. So cool. That's a good way.

00:32:46:04 - 00:33:03:16
Unknown
You know, if he sometimes giving out ten tickets sells you on 100. So yeah, I'm definitely all for that. Especially, you know, the right people. That's kind of exact. This is exactly what I was hoping for was that we'd, like, be able to like, you know, give a little to, like, create the abundance and flow that we need.

00:33:03:18 - 00:33:26:20
Unknown
And then with, like, how does, like at sound is like a $500 give to the. But then it's like a ticket and. Right, right. Or a writing ale between 3 and 5. I feel like people love the option. And the more affordable tickets are or maybe it's not three, but like well over point so that people feel like there's some option.

00:33:26:20 - 00:33:47:16
Unknown
I've found that people generally go to the full price unless they really are unable to pay, and sometimes those people are the people that make their their friends that can pay for 15 tickets. Come, you know. Yeah, it's one of those kind of tricky things within our community has so much going on pretty much literally every day of the week.

00:33:47:16 - 00:34:15:24
Unknown
I can go to something that's cooler than anything most people get to go to. So it's kind of it's rough. Yeah. Well, so with that idea, you know, you have to keep it in a in a ballpark. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, that's kind of like. Yeah, I'm. I'm okay with that. But I'm also thinking about, like, like pitching it in the framework that this is a fundraiser for this larger thing and that has the part of the pitch.

00:34:15:24 - 00:34:49:24
Unknown
Yeah, I agree, but I think there is that potential. So, like, we sold our secrets of the C weekend for 325 and we tickets, we didn't sell 100 tickets we wanted. We sold like 60 tickets, but it was pinching it constantly making reels, having people promoting like real promotion, hard promotion. Because that's a big ticket. So I guess what I'm thinking is maybe if you start in price point at 325, which would make some money and cover costs.

00:34:50:01 - 00:35:09:12
Unknown
Yeah. You know, that way the people that can afford the 500 would never say no, right? They're just always going to pay the 500. But you do have this option. You know, one person can create a whole crowd that's in there. Often it's the person who can't afford it, which is kind of funny, you know? Yeah. Because, well, because they can't afford it.

00:35:09:12 - 00:35:26:02
Unknown
Because they're the cool person that's going out and being with the people instead of fucking working and spending all the money on art and spending all their money on making art. Yeah, I, I'm definitely, fully in support of that. So I thought, and it's easy enough to put that sliding scale and make people feel they have an option.

00:35:26:07 - 00:35:42:15
Unknown
Yeah. Well, I think what we'd have to do within this, like, since it's like the giveth campaign, like we could have one that's like, hey, there's like there's like this ticket and there's like maybe like this many of them available and then there's like the 500 available and they're like just different price points. Yeah. You could certainly do that.

00:35:42:15 - 00:36:06:02
Unknown
And, and everyone loves these stage prices. Everybody loves like, get it early. Yeah. Exactly. And also part of this with this giveth is this is just proving our, our worth in the platform. So this is like the first, like, initial campaign that we launched. So having this like campaign be successful, it'll then create more opportunities with giveth.

00:36:06:02 - 00:36:29:13
Unknown
And that's really crucial because giveth has this thing they're releasing next year called curves which is a basically creating crypto tokens for public good. This a nonprofit organizations that then are traded in the giveth ecosystem. And it's got like all these fancy bonding curves that, balance the price of the token and how much of the tokens are being emitted.

00:36:29:13 - 00:36:55:16
Unknown
So it like creates a really abundant liquid pool for people to be trading in so that we get this micro economy within our own crypto token related to our nonprofit, and so we can operate and have a more liquid flowing than a traditional nonprofit. And so that's kind of parting. So having this campaign being successful, so save it making a little bit less, I think is more is less important than having the campaign be successful.

00:36:55:21 - 00:37:13:08
Unknown
Yeah. That's kind of how I, I and you know that's sort of I've looked at this year with Forbes Island it's like charge the cheapest price we can. So the people are exposed to it and know how to get there. You know, and know that it's worth the effort of figuring the ferry system out. Yeah, I was actually one.

00:37:13:08 - 00:37:28:05
Unknown
I want to, like, pitch that like I wanted to be like and part of our pitch, like the rustic experience that like part of it is like you're in the city and you're in all these things, like. But no, this is like a get like a ferry getaway to be like in a different world. Even though, like, the city's like right there.

00:37:28:05 - 00:38:05:07
Unknown
You can get to it. But like, this is like a separation from the world. This is intentionally creating and container after like a few days that like allows and has no taxes. Yeah. That doesn't have society's rules of quiet or having lights everywhere you go or everything easy, you know. Yeah. And I, I find that really the off grid ness and really talking about, the fact that there's, there's no power drop, there's no well, there's no septic, that we are just in-house handling all things in in a way that is kind of shocking.

00:38:05:07 - 00:38:28:12
Unknown
I'm actually really surprised we've been able to pull it off and tell you the truth. But, you know, we've made our own boat for pumping out our own septic system, and we bring that to land. And I own the Marina so I can have it put into our sewer system. So like, we really have made it so we are sustainable, you know, and I think that people really love that.

00:38:28:12 - 00:39:01:09
Unknown
I think they love the idea of like going somewhere and seeing something that's just being powered by a boat with a bunch of solar panels, you know, it's very cool. Yeah, I agree, and I well, that's part of the emphasis of that. I want to like, have with the event is like on doing things in a regenerative manner, like not having like a bunch of plastic available for like food and different things and trying to source our food from local farms within the area as much as possible, and really creating this foundation that we are really walking the talk that we're there to talk about.

00:39:01:12 - 00:39:26:09
Unknown
Exactly, exactly. And and we are really I mean, the thing is, we are 45 minutes from Oakland, but we are also ten minutes from five farm stands where you can meet the farmer who raises to produce. It's really actually organic or is organic is plastic. Rain is. But and you can see the cow alive today and have it on your table tomorrow if you want.

00:39:26:13 - 00:39:46:03
Unknown
You know, it's a very rare thing, but what about your cows? Are they are they up for grabs? Yeah, they're we don't need every cat. I'm kidding. They're my friends. They look way too cute. They are super cute. Friendly. It is. Stand out there in the field, all shaggy and cute. And they're so sweet. They're very kind of cows.

00:39:46:18 - 00:40:08:15
Unknown
And at that point, they'll be, like, happy and romping around you. Now it's pretty exciting that. Yeah, they're pretty small. These are big cows here. And there's Electric Avenue. Yeah. Oh, there's Electric Avenue looking cute. Bruce there built that. Great. Yeah. Well, I built it with Bruce. Okay. Oh. With Bruce money. Okay. That was it. Yeah I remember I was that's where I met Bruce.

00:40:08:15 - 00:40:30:09
Unknown
Or was on that boat actually. Yeah. I, you know, and cook and Brewster, that guy. So sweet. But you know they reached is internet Archive. Yeah. Like a huge thing for supercomputers. It's still, happen. It's it's it's. Yeah, I think it's fixed it with lots of, you know, how do you check to see if anything's been changed, right?

00:40:30:09 - 00:40:55:03
Unknown
Yeah. I mean, yes, I mean, we're tracking the use, like. Yes. Uses a supercomputer. I think that, yeah, these supercomputers got hacked, so, like, there. Really? No, that's what I was just. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The real problem is that Wayback Machine was the only actually record in the history of the internet that was accurate, because nobody's actually why Greg is now working on one of the projects that he's doing for distributed creatives.

00:40:55:03 - 00:41:27:14
Unknown
Yeah. That's, I would love that to be part of the focus, actually. Totally. Because there's, Yeah, a lot of people are going to be passionate about that. Yeah, we could ask or I can call brew or whatever, and I would love that, honestly. Yeah, that sounds great. I'm just going to say that in all of his turmoil, like 1 or 2 weeks after the big hack happened and all of that, he actually went out and physically bought me a card because he couldn't come to my birthday party and sent me a physical card in the mail, like a real human is.

00:41:27:16 - 00:41:43:11
Unknown
So, so I have now had a wooden card made for them that's etched in stone, and I'm not as good as him. I it's not saying I haven't sent it. He's definitely, part of the inspiration for where am at with Greg. It was like year when we first when I met him, he was like, well, we'll work for me.

00:41:43:11 - 00:42:10:22
Unknown
It was just giving everything away for free. Yep, that's Brewster and it's working well, I mean, even in all of this, Bristol will come out the other end still with an internet archive. So, you know, maybe that's okay. So I also have, like, Lee's and who works at ESF and like, oh, yeah, I have like some of my absolute very best friends are at the highest level of cybersecurity for a lot of the stuff.

00:42:10:24 - 00:42:30:24
Unknown
Maybe that's a piece. Maybe we have some. Please. Yeah, we have a password. Right. Lee's to speak, and I invite Jake to speak. And Jake actually helped me put together Electric Avenue because he's a solar genius. Well, he's just a straight genius, but where's what is Jake working on or what? Who are you? No. Jake sent secret. No.

00:42:30:24 - 00:42:58:14
Unknown
He said no one knows what Jake is working on. I, Jake owns. Or am I allowed to say this in my room? I have Alexis. Jake has the longest standing anarchist web page in America. Okay. Wow. Yeah, and he's just a goofy little dude. He's the one legged guy. Matty, did you meet him? It's got, like, a prosthetic, like kangaroo foot, which is pretty good.

00:42:58:14 - 00:43:20:23
Unknown
Did jump. Anyways, he is, like, super close friend of mine. I most certainly, if we gave him heads up, couldn't get him there. So, maybe we'll get Ross Ulbricht out there too, because he's going to be free. Let's try it again. Maybe we can do panels then with the folks and and vitamins. Panelists. That'd be amazing.

00:43:20:23 - 00:43:40:21
Unknown
Yeah, that sounds great. That's exactly the kind of things I'm looking for. And if we invited, like, I'll just guilt Jake and Liz in the coming period, you know? Well, that's it. I'll be like, hey, yeah, you missed this one thing. You have to come to this, and get them on a panel. I think they would appreciate having that space.

00:43:42:00 - 00:44:02:24
Unknown
Yeah, that'd be great. And there. And it's, the, the island is a Faraday cage, right? Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. You're downstairs. Yeah. You. There's nothing. Well, now we have, actually, as soon as we put the starling down there, maybe not anymore, but it was. It was. So there's a downstairs. It's, like. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:44:03:01 - 00:44:25:16
Unknown
You know, huge two. Oh, beautiful restaurant with bar, dark wood. Let's see, you didn't go to Forbes Island and, dot com, and you'll probably go, oh, yeah, there's a lot of good photos there. And, you know, our hip camp has the best photos, I think. Oh, that's a hip campsite. Yeah. We have have camp that we're renting on hip camp an Airbnb.

00:44:25:18 - 00:44:49:03
Unknown
Okay, okay. So. Oh there's our Wikipedia okay. That's our. It's kind of dirty. Okay, I don't know, I don't know I failed all this fun site. I'm still a little messy. There's inside at the bar, and this is inside our house. This is our secrets. See? See if we get some mermaids that's inside. Inside. I want a bigger inside.

00:44:49:05 - 00:45:11:02
Unknown
That's inside. Where is the fireplace? This has great. Yeah, it's got a huge, beautiful fireplace to work at. Like you're booking at wherever. That book now is probably up at the top. Yeah, I try that. Let's see if we get the interiors. I think it has the bedrooms and everything. Yeah, that has everything. 25 photos. Kitchen. Yeah. Has it all.

00:45:11:04 - 00:45:33:24
Unknown
Ooh. Pretty. Yeah. It's really beautiful inside it's. And that fireplace was like, four by three or something. Yeah. Hold on. This person has called twice that. It's probably a relatively important that. Yeah I don't do the pictures. So that's the the bar with the fireplace. Gorgeous. Yeah. If you need to take call that's fine. We've got she's.

00:45:34:02 - 00:46:03:12
Unknown
Yeah. Okay. Got it. So yeah. This is answering a lot of questions for me for sure. I want to just make sure. And I think we're getting closer to this. The the what? We're going to be doing there. She mentioned the Culture Club. We've talked about the Internet Archive and f and creating a panel.

00:46:03:14 - 00:46:39:10
Unknown
I just want to, like, figure out. And that sounds like the answer to the question, what do people want to attend for? But I want to see if there's, you know, you your focus is the Earth Art party. And I want to just kind of make sure we have a good understanding of what we're going to be presenting, you know, and certainly if we can talk about the Internet Archive f our initiative with the, forever sites.

00:46:39:12 - 00:47:10:11
Unknown
Yes. And kind of bundle that together, that'll, get a lot of interest on the, and fundraising through giveth. Yeah. And, I think that's kind of what we need is something really, you know, different that people have a lot of passion for. Yeah. I also would like to, have Magento of the Bloom Network come out and present what they're doing with the Bloom Network, and they already have a successful project on giveth.

00:47:10:11 - 00:47:32:22
Unknown
And the Bloom Network is a distributed power organization is probably the best way to describe it. It's got a few people at the top, not even at the top, but that make sure things are happening and staying organized. And like the websites being developed and that's magenta. And then it provides framework for community, regenerative community at the, at the local level.

00:47:32:22 - 00:47:52:10
Unknown
And so it's framework for local organizers to build regenerative community. And they just released their new website and they've got like a grant program where you get paid retroactively for doing regenerative work in your community. And it's just kind of continuing to ramp up. And that was, tech and culture and food kind of all wrapped up into it.

00:47:52:10 - 00:48:28:02
Unknown
So that's kind of where I feel like for me, like the what it represents is like this new tech culture, security, like holistic lifestyle. Yeah, I agree, I also have this other man named indie who's a podcaster. He is a he's like mix of art, spiritualism and eco. He's kind of a he was actually brought to me, Maddie, by John Connor, who's our god, trying to start some other hackathon on or dumb project with me.

00:48:28:12 - 00:48:48:02
Unknown
And then it ends up being, like, bites themselves in the butt, like within two days and my boss fires him and we end up working with indie. But that is in these last name, I think it's Sigma, indie, as in Indiana Jones, like indie indie. Let's see, I think. Yeah, one of my I grew up with a good friend named indie.

00:48:48:04 - 00:49:15:16
Unknown
Let me see if I can find his last name. Use a. I'm working with him tomorrow. But he's doing an, indie Ricci singer, so it's indie y Irish. I s I n g h and let's see if he has a, here's his LinkedIn. Yeah. He's so he's on LinkedIn. He's a political hope podcaster. Political hope.

00:49:15:18 - 00:49:39:14
Unknown
Yeah. Political hope. I like that. So, you know, somebody I could certainly drag into this if we're interested in drag him in. I'll let you know how it goes. He's a weird one. I oh, those are my people. Yeah. Right here. Yesterday, I said, you know, I'm doing this lavender hill planting with him tomorrow with. And he is doing this whole, this whole thing around it.

00:49:39:14 - 00:50:03:20
Unknown
But he said he's bringing crypto like crazy to my project site. So, let's see if that's true. And I'm going to make them all plant lavender. So it, it may, you know, I said to him, so, you know, what's the logistics for tomorrow? And then he's like, I'm providing a container and you bring creativity. I'm like, no, I mean, like where we setting our table up because I have to tell my interns where to go.

00:50:03:22 - 00:50:24:10
Unknown
He's like, wherever you want, I need, like, this is sort of making me crazy. Tell me what your skill I'm like. I worked for a resource conservation district. We need to know where our table is going to be because we have interns, but, But. So he's that guy. But I could see him doing a program. Some small piece of his own.

00:50:24:11 - 00:50:47:02
Unknown
If if we're looking for time at fillers with different people doing different things, you know, and maybe this is a crypto piece, funder for eco restorations, which is when he's kind of focusing on okay, that. Yeah. That's right. And aligned with Bloom Network. Yeah. So just maybe research him. I'm afraid to because I have to work with him either way.

00:50:47:04 - 00:51:07:21
Unknown
Like I've listened to a couple of his podcast. They're they're interesting. He definitely has an interesting angle on things. I don't disagree with them about that. I can't decide if I agree 100% with them, but I don't have to, you know, and I'd also like to bring like, make sure we bring some diversity into this organization or this event.

00:51:08:10 - 00:51:27:15
Unknown
And also like, I think it is important to be able to not necessarily bring in people that you don't like fully agree with, but you know them. You know, we don't have to mess. I don't want I want to be mindful of not just curating things that just like, I don't know, are only like, what we love and like trying to, like, force our reality on the world.

00:51:27:18 - 00:51:33:13
Unknown
Yeah, I 100% agree. Yeah.

00:51:33:15 - 00:51:59:10
Unknown
Well, great. Super exciting. Yeah. So I think we'll probably Maddie and I will, work on this. Yeah. And I think, I think we'll need to get buy in from all of these people. Right. Pretty soon. So we'll have to put something together, maybe publish it on the site. Yes. And kind of they can go to would be great.

00:51:59:15 - 00:52:19:08
Unknown
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. It's everybody. How are the feelings about my idea for the name? I am completely open to doing something totally different. It's right in the chat. I want to look at it in text. Okay. I can drop it in that. Okay.

00:52:19:10 - 00:52:37:20
Unknown
You got it, Matty. Or do you want me to? I got it, yeah, I wasn't sure. I didn't hear it. And here we go. Is that right? Okay.

00:52:37:22 - 00:53:02:13
Unknown
I like the name. I like the use of the larger letters to. I like it. Cool. I do my smaller other than big ass. And that's just like there'll be like some party elements, but it's going to be more of like a conference, like there'll be some music and stuff. But like, in my mind, it's going to be like, you know, 2 or 3 workshops throughout the day and then like a lunch or whatever.

00:53:02:13 - 00:53:30:07
Unknown
So it's not like it's not just like jam packed where it's like endless information that it's more geared towards, like workshops and the reality is sometimes I've found at conferences in a way offering like two opposing workshops, I don't, you know, it depends on if the people are okay with that. If you have a lot of content and don't want to do it in a lot of hours, you can say, there's this one on, you know that and this one on this.

00:53:30:07 - 00:53:51:03
Unknown
You can go to the one with three stars, or you can go to the one with the F, you know, so I'm equally, strong as long as they're equally strong but have a different slant so that people have that choice of either or. That way people aren't bored seeing things they don't want to see. And also, it's action packed, like people have to decide when they're going to.

00:53:51:03 - 00:54:16:08
Unknown
And, you know, I think I also think it's probably would be hard to get all people like, if everybody wants to go to that, wants to go to the one. And it's like in the in, it's in Forbes. That would be like pretty. It would be pretty intense. We probably had 650 people sitting on the ground is what we how we did it so we could fit the most people in front of.

00:54:16:08 - 00:54:35:00
Unknown
We had like a little piece of the circus inside. We had like burlesque kind of things and a girl and a balloon or whatever. And so there's space, but it would definitely. So the tiki lounge upstairs, I don't know if there's a picture there. This is the inside of the. I would say you're looking at the lighthouse here.

00:54:35:02 - 00:55:00:16
Unknown
See if you get a tiki lounge. Okay. That's the master bedroom. There was the tiki lounge one after, because I saw the big captain in it. Yeah, yeah, he's probably in there. There's that. It. That's the bar. That's a bar? Yeah, that's a bar. That's the hallway. If you go back, that's the hallway we sat people in because it's really long and then had somebody at the very end there as the, the performer.

00:55:01:19 - 00:55:05:11
Unknown
The land.

00:55:05:13 - 00:55:30:00
Unknown
So. Clamp. That's still there. That's good. Gorgeous. Gorgeous. Bedrooms. Yeah. They're beautiful. They're absolutely beautiful. Okay, that's the bar again. That's. There's like a living room area within the bar to like a smaller little area. Oh, that's a circus. That's the tiki house right there, actually. Just go outside of it outside. And so it fits like, I don't know.

00:55:30:00 - 00:55:50:11
Unknown
I've had 12 people sleeping there with sleeping that mats. So, it's a weird shape. So it's 520 by 40 or 30. Yeah. Sounds about right. And then like that. So you can fit. So but if you were to divide them into two groups, then you have like a comfortable space where they can interact too and ask questions more I think.

00:55:50:13 - 00:56:12:04
Unknown
And maybe like for the larger thing. So whatever it is, maybe it's probably I would think, the idea of the forever sites and Brewster and those because that's more along with what we are doing too. I mean, not that the if isn't, but you know, that's, that's us kind of showcasing part of ours, I would say have that daytime outside upstairs.

00:56:12:04 - 00:56:36:16
Unknown
I know that sounds weird like, but yeah, that's the inside. You can fit the most people. Yeah. That's the inside of the tiki lounge. Okay. Cool. And they're mostly empty like we don't have, but we have a lot of chairs, so like probably 70 or 80 chairs and very nice, comfortable chairs. Lots of tables, but we kind of leave it empty so you can kind of take all of those and put them places.

00:56:36:16 - 00:56:57:23
Unknown
So you're not dealing with furniture in the way and things like that. So, it can be staged how you want it to, which is it's nice because then, you know, you don't have to like, move a bunch of stuff out to make it happen. So and the outside area you're suggesting, what do you think the occupancy there is right there now?

00:56:57:23 - 00:57:20:20
Unknown
I mean, there's a lot is that this, far corner? It's our upper deck. And so and then this on the lower kind of right is see where all the docks are in front. If you go, like in line with Electric Avenue, a bit towards the docks could move the docks into the frame. Other docks. Sorry. There's some other words.

00:57:20:20 - 00:57:41:22
Unknown
The, towards the house part of the island. So you can see there where there's a sign that says Forbes Island. Maybe you can see it. There's three, three docks. And then above it is that like sign? Yeah. Right in there. That is a the same size as a tiki lounge, but it is now a really beautiful deck with, arbor over it.

00:57:41:22 - 00:58:13:12
Unknown
And, like, that's where we cook and things. But any of that can still be moved for sitting, you know, and then the barbecue can be put back. So, again, that's another big space. But if you were to have the lecture, the people sitting, to the left, on that deck, people can actually hear if you have a microphone and see all the way up to kind of the front of even the front of the island.

00:58:13:14 - 00:58:34:03
Unknown
So where you can see people as well. And we have lots of little square tables and round tables, so you can put like 3 or 4 chairs around them. That kind of makes it, it seems like it would take up more space, but you can fit a lot of people around a table. So, I would say that's the largest opportunity unless we did it on the docks.

00:58:34:08 - 00:58:53:06
Unknown
Oh, really did it? And I bring in if you go over and go to the oh, this is not the map anymore. And the map, there's that crane barge. You can have the speaker on that. Bring it up and people can. So yeah, that would be wild. That's what we did. Most of the performance is on that crane barge.

00:58:53:06 - 00:59:22:15
Unknown
So if you go over to your towards the lighthouse towards and then keep going, keep going, keep going. Oh this that's the crane barge. And a lot of my docks. This must have been pre and post ephemera how they took this picture. Because everything's in front of it. But I have the movie barge there to Matty, which is shown, and that's like, 50 by 45.

00:59:22:17 - 00:59:50:13
Unknown
So technically, this crane barge can actually drive right up over to Forbes Island into the opening in our dock area with the movie barge, even in front of it or docks in front of it. A movie barge is huge. Yeah. And the movie barge is you can have your speaker on the docks in front of the crane barge facing all of our docks, which is, you know, hundreds and hundreds of feet of seating with your feet in the water if you want.

00:59:51:21 - 01:00:12:23
Unknown
So that's doable too. There's like a lot of opportunities depending on people. So then people would sit in that big you right, of all over those docks and on the boat and on forums, you know you can have that would be yeah, that would be the definitely the place for a couple keynote, presentations. Yeah.

01:00:12:23 - 01:00:34:09
Unknown
Or at like entry, you know. Yeah. Sit them down as they come in and you have a speech or, you know, things like that can happen as people are entering. You know, there's a lot now because it's on the water and because I on so many extra docks, we can build it out however we want on the water in the outside lanes.

01:00:34:11 - 01:00:54:20
Unknown
We actually have a little mini golf course now. Am I going crazy? I now it was brought to us because it was stolen last year from Brewster actually, and so he didn't have one for ephemera. So we built him a new one. And then last week I got a call and they had recovered it. The sheriff's had found it.

01:00:54:20 - 01:01:18:12
Unknown
And now where are we putting it? So now it's at Forbes Island, too. Oh man. It just keeps building this huge. And that one has it's very flat and it has astroturf on the whole thing. So it's like a big green space. It's hilarious. So like, we just have lots of different spaces, which is like, that's where I thought maybe if you had multiple things going, you have all these different locations.

01:01:18:18 - 01:01:44:08
Unknown
People can even maybe move throughout them if they wanted to catch that, and then they're like, oh, this is boring. Go over to the other one. I'm real conference style. I love that this makes me so excited. I mean, I love it. I am just like in love with the idea of it being used like this. Honestly. Besides just the party, but really as a place where people can present things if it's art or if it's.

01:01:44:10 - 01:02:06:18
Unknown
Yeah, I mean, I do like, we, I do like we can use this as a showcase for, to produce other for other to bring other people's, conferences and things there. I agree, I agree. So, you know, how do you get these rocks to float like this? Yeah. What are those? Let's see what else. It's pretty cool. Thing is, you got a Zero-G thing there,

01:02:06:20 - 01:02:31:05
Unknown
Yeah. That's a credible. What is that? Uppers. Glass? It is, but, very, joking aside, I'm wondering, so, when I lived in the area, I would have been using my own sound systems, but I'm wondering if, you know anyone. Sure does, because we're going to need mics and for speakers and all of that as well.

01:02:31:05 - 01:02:51:18
Unknown
And you're on a budget. I have a wall of speakers just to let you know, and they don't want to move them out. I was like, well, then just leave them here. So I have one, I have eight, I have a stack of eight that fills the entire wall, from ceiling to floor. And I have a mixing board already there.

01:02:51:20 - 01:03:16:02
Unknown
Wow. Okay. So and that can be augmented, like, if, if, if Debbie's invited and all of those people and I say, hey, Jimmy, come deejay and bring your sound system or whatever, and, you know, we'll we give them a fair they, they charge me for my birthday, which is pretty ridiculous, really. $1,100. And they brought all their equipment and 11 deejays that played all night long.

01:03:16:05 - 01:03:38:12
Unknown
So, you know, I we don't want that kind of deal because nobody gets paid. But we can always I mean, they're doing this, like, for my birthday party kind of thing, but, we can always make a very kind of low, not low. But, you know, if we pitch them some money, they're happy to do it and just do it at a lesser, you know, not as many deejays.

01:03:38:13 - 01:04:00:23
Unknown
I mean, if we even if we hit that 30 mark, we should be able to pay anybody, a good chunk of money. Yeah. And so, you know, I need to send Jobi the stats on the speakers, too, because he'll want his own soundboard bent like that. It's so much easier. Like, if the speakers are there, you're it's easy.

01:04:01:00 - 01:04:23:07
Unknown
It's easy. It's a speaker's going have you can imagine little people with lots of speakers going down that 100ft dock, you know. Right. You said you have the amps too. Yeah. Yeah, we have all of it there right now. We have the whole stack right now. So, basically he he said, use it. I if I can leave the speakers here and not leave them, keep it.

01:04:23:07 - 01:05:00:22
Unknown
So, I can just kind of verify with them that it would be there that long, I think is really the trick because it's there now, right? Yeah. So, speaking of the time. So, yeah, the timing, ephemeral is in July. Yes. Last week. Right. And it was it did we determined that it's a good idea to be in concert with that in some way, like either a week before or after, or does that make any does it matter that we're working with that and maybe we should be shooting for before it, or what do you guys think?

01:05:01:01 - 01:05:35:18
Unknown
I would think before, because burning everybody's going to be like in the head afterwards. Last till September. Yeah. Very nice weather still here. Yeah. I feel like it would be good for us to get this going in the in July. Well early like late June, early July I think because yeah I don't know I feel like potentially like if it's like right on like right the week before ephemeral I think it might be a little bit too much for people trying to get all their heads around.

01:05:35:20 - 01:05:59:21
Unknown
I'll hide because I've been there when if people are getting ready for a fever, I'll be like, oh, she had her boats broken. Like, oh fuck yeah. And when is that? Like, I just know it's July somewhere in July. July 21st is that week. The July. Yeah, the last week. So whatever this the last week of July. What it is this year.

01:05:59:23 - 01:06:31:12
Unknown
Okay. So it's there I will be living there. You know officially probably that start the 21st and go 2627. They're the big party. The big 20. Yeah 2526 is the big weekend. And then I probably won't even be back until, you know, forever time August 3rd. So I'm pretty much out ephemera from the 21st to the end of the first week of August.

01:06:31:14 - 01:06:50:20
Unknown
And then you're in the 4th of July and people are leaving. Maybe. Yeah, that's why I was thinking like maybe like an yeah, because fourth of anyways like maybe mid-June could be good to find out. So we also have this thing called Big Stick that everybody goes to for a week. And I usually have an art project.

01:06:50:20 - 01:07:13:06
Unknown
I don't I'm going to try not to have an art project that takes five months this year. Yeah. Even though it's really fun, but it's still a lot of work. And I think that, when did I do really big stick? Last year. Stick?

01:07:13:08 - 01:07:40:18
Unknown
I probably other get big stick shindig. It last year was June 9th year before June 8th. June 10th, June 11th, June 12th. Okay. So it looks like it's usually that first week in June. And so everybody's coming back on the 12th actually. Let me look at let's look at Heidi's calendar for last year. And I will tell you what.

01:07:40:19 - 01:08:06:20
Unknown
Most of the things happen where they happened. Let's see. So then Burning Man is like August 30th or whatever, right? Like the end of August that my people head out on the eighth because they have to they did three weeks of install of projects. Which is insane. I mean, they must just be so exhausted because it's exhausting.

01:08:06:22 - 01:08:30:08
Unknown
Yeah, I've done that. Yeah. I had so hard. I don't I feel for them. I require a month after Burning Man to recover if I'm, not doing too much there. Well, you just get. So your body's just over it, right? It's just over it. Okay, let's look at June. What happened in June? But, yeah, this all sounds good, right?

01:08:30:08 - 01:08:52:16
Unknown
There it goes. You should probably also, you know, as we talk to some people, find dates that would work for them too. Yeah, but why don't we just throw out a bunch of weekends? Yeah, and then get them all on it. You know, I'll have them do it all or something. That sounds great. That's the racket. It's,

01:08:52:18 - 01:09:16:23
Unknown
So now, not too bad in June, other than. And we want to shoot for, Saturday. Sunday, right. Yeah. Friday. Saturday. Yeah. Friday. Saturday. And like. Yeah, Sunday. Everybody's kind of maybe have, like a breakfast and then kind of start to inhale. Yeah. And the first ferry on Sundays at 11 which is really good. And then the last ones at three.

01:09:16:23 - 01:09:42:13
Unknown
So if they're driving there that gives them a nice window to like break down and load. So are we thinking one day or are we going two days with camping. Yeah. What. Yeah. Which are we thinking. Well I was thinking like get in like Friday afternoon. And then Saturday is kind of like the day of talking and all the things.

01:09:42:14 - 01:10:06:04
Unknown
And then Sunday. Sunday is the leave. I mean, that's what I found to be the easiest timeline, really. I know it seems like a lot of that Friday is really them coming in and setting up tents. And, you know, that whole day takes a lot of, air out of people. They need to sleep that first night, and then Saturday they wake up and they're ready to do things.

01:10:06:06 - 01:10:36:18
Unknown
Yeah. What about, power? I'm assuming there's power on the island for the sound system and things like that. You need to run lights in the campgrounds and all that as well. I'm just kind of in, like, bring your lanterns, pretend you're in the middle of nowhere. Okay. We can, you know, basically, if you got a string of solar lights and also by then, my guess is we will have installed our outdoor kitchen on the campground, too.

01:10:36:20 - 01:11:02:24
Unknown
Oh, beautiful. And maybe even our region farm, which would be fabulous, because that's all kind of coming up in, in spring. So my partner's one is a, landscape architect that works with food and sustainability. So he wants to do like, you know, starting with probably an acre and going to, like a three acre little farm ground, planting, like, with pathways to get through and flowers, like he does.

01:11:02:24 - 01:11:25:16
Unknown
It's kind of beautiful display of food and flowers. So that could all even be there, which is a whole nother neat aspect of that land. Could be any aspect. We have a meeting next week and we just got a a big check, so it's possible that someone could. And. Yeah, it's possible, because we're an LLC looking at begging.

01:11:25:16 - 01:11:53:05
Unknown
Yeah. Begging LLC right now, like there are no donations. We do. We do rag. Yeah. He has a huge, group of folks to go. We'd like to, you know, be a great person to present as well. Yeah, absolutely. And he would love to. I all runs the biggest drag. Festival, on the West Coast. Oh, fun.

01:11:53:06 - 01:12:13:23
Unknown
All my partners, drag queens at the there aren't you wouldn't know it looking at them, but I actually I've never seen them in drag so that's interesting. I would not I don't know if I'd even recognize them, to be honest with you, but they're all the famous drag queens. So who who what would they be talking about?

01:12:14:11 - 01:12:35:21
Unknown
Well, regenerate stuff. Okay. Yeah, it would be region stuff and farming. Really? And, I'm looking. June's not too bad. So I'm looking at the 27 through the 29th, which is the last week of June. Let's go look at that.

01:12:35:23 - 01:13:01:20
Unknown
This week of June. Okay. So that would probably be. So look at those two weekends. Okay. So there's a summer solstice and there's seven summer solstice parties on my thing from last year I did not yeah I never made it to any of them. Only building part. So, That's good. None of that looks too bad.

01:13:01:22 - 01:13:28:24
Unknown
Or are they are the 20th to the 22nd. See the 20? Yeah, I like that. Sounds good. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Let's see that. Yeah. I mean those are that's the solstice. So there could be but I mean, I think if we put it out early enough that we should be able to be draw, get the draw we need or does compassion distribution, but that's a one time thing.

01:13:29:01 - 01:13:42:04
Unknown
I want to be our club cinema party, but they will move their parties for me. And I just have to make sure they don't do that party that we can.

01:13:42:06 - 01:14:08:18
Unknown
Check. Checking. Otherwise, that looks like a good weekend. Oh, I'm always down to align ourselves with the astrological phenomena. Yeah, yeah. But that will be the solstice, won't it? Yeah. Oh, I mean, yeah, there's a lot of competition for that weekend. It might be better to do it the week before. Yeah, I would think to do the week before.

01:14:08:22 - 01:14:24:16
Unknown
Yeah. Let me make sure that doesn't fall into that weekend. I wish I could just pick a new year and then have to scroll through all the seven one. Let me see.

01:14:24:18 - 01:14:41:03
Unknown
What year? My end now and then start. Does it look like I already had a big stick on your.

01:14:41:05 - 01:14:48:13
Unknown
So what weekend is that? That's,

01:14:48:15 - 01:15:19:17
Unknown
June 20th through the 22nd. I we try for maybe the weekend before we do. Like the. Friday the 13th. Oh, yeah. And that's, Sunday's Father's Day. The. Oh, yeah. Some days are off. Especially the weekends. Yeah. And if we're, we can't compete with big stick like that, there's no competition with. Yeah I mean the first week of June I think that'll be big stick.

01:15:19:19 - 01:15:26:11
Unknown
Oh okay. Well never mind. So let's go back down.

01:15:26:13 - 01:16:05:08
Unknown
Or are we start Saturday? What day is the solstice? It is the 21st of those morning. Oh, then maybe the 27th through the 29th, then the last. That's like. I think we're booked. Okay. And, yeah, that's Jeremy's weekend. What is with all these months? He. Yeah. Active life, I know. I mean, would lay would late, maybe decent, maybe I, you know, more likely I mean, nothing's I mean, there's like Mother's Day, but that's early, right?

01:16:05:10 - 01:16:15:10
Unknown
Yeah. Being maybe.

01:16:15:12 - 01:16:20:14
Unknown
It's like at that.

01:16:20:16 - 01:16:53:20
Unknown
You should not much in May. People are fearful of May because of weather. Yeah. Yeah I have thrown two festivals in the last two years and had perfect weather like 89 degrees 80 in, in this beautiful. Yeah. So Mother's Day, Sunday the 11th. I'm not seeing a lot of event events. Yeah. Like, I mean like the 30th through the first.

01:16:53:22 - 01:17:13:19
Unknown
Yeah. I mean, maybe that's the best way that might work. Yeah, I my feeling is the further out the better for all of the planning you're trying to do. Yeah, I do agree. Yeah I would do the 30 or 30 first and first because then the 4th of July is what the Wednesday of that week for. Oh that's June okay.

01:17:13:19 - 01:17:43:16
Unknown
So yeah I think that's a good weekend. Cool. Yeah. Let's tentatively put that out there. Maybe event. Let's see. Could we do the next one. Well the next one's is was big would be big stick. But I'd love to have a couple of weekends to round up. All that and hope for the best, you know, I mean, there's like the 24th, third through the 25th through the 30th through the first.

01:17:43:18 - 01:18:07:15
Unknown
Yeah. The choices. Yeah. And I mean, we could potentially do it the week after, July 4th of July too. Yeah. Yeah. I think those are the three dates that seem like they're the most viable. And then we kind of talk to everybody and see what kind of works. Yeah. And maybe July 11th through the 13. Yeah.

01:18:07:17 - 01:18:14:03
Unknown
Yeah, I like that too. Yeah, I did too.

01:18:14:05 - 01:18:43:14
Unknown
Okay. And that's pretty ephemeral enough I think. And maybe we start with that date. We go back. Yeah. Because that's. Hi, Summer. Yeah. It's warm. It's pretty. People want to get out here. I mean, in summer, you know, it's fair weather, friends. Right now. All of a sudden, everybody just wants to come visit all the time. Yeah, yeah, like 15 people that are like, oh, we need to be here.

01:18:43:16 - 01:19:23:20
Unknown
Yeah. So yeah, I guess the only then is for us to decide if we want to do, Well, I, you know, if it's 30, it even if it's 100 people. Not that I want to say that, we can also boat people in and out. So here's the logistics. If you want to go to Bradford Island Ferry and pop that web page up, you know, look at this super fun, terrible schedule.

01:19:23:22 - 01:19:52:19
Unknown
Yep. Very, so, so here's our terrible schedule, that we there's a couple choices there that we do have. You know, Saturdays are, like, ridiculous. It's like nine to noon getting off. Right. And the noon is not a coming to the island. It's a leaving the island, because they park on land. But, you know, if we're really nice to,

01:19:52:21 - 01:20:15:09
Unknown
And, you know, we ask a way in advance, they'll be okay with people coming over on that 12 p.m. ferry, because sometimes other people come on that ferry. But, you know, lots of communication with them. But on the, on the the best way I've found to do it, if you're going to try to do a Friday to Saturday and have people be able to get home on Saturday, you can end.

01:20:15:09 - 01:20:45:24
Unknown
So Friday night being like the party, right? And Saturday being presentations and part of Friday being presentations or however you want to work that you can pay $150 for for every extra hour after the last ferry so that we could pay, you know, until two it would be $300. Right. And same with the Friday I find during those Fridays until seven has benefited me because people can get off work, get to the location and get on that ferry.

01:20:46:01 - 01:21:13:23
Unknown
Right. So, who needs to use the ferry? This isn't that. This is. But you can get to it by car, right? So if you drive on to the ferry. Oh, okay. Yeah. So it's only like, it's a very short ferry ride. It's like five minutes. Yeah, yeah. So the, Right, there's the landing if you back out, it's literally a little it's that tip in the tip right there.

01:21:13:23 - 01:21:37:02
Unknown
The two points. One is the Bradford Island ferry. So it picks you up a little farther. That's where it lands. Oh, that's where it lands. That's where. Yeah okay. I had yeah. It looked like it was I. Gotcha. So you are we are off grid. We have not had access. So after that 5:00 ferry you are the only ones you know.

01:21:37:02 - 01:22:06:11
Unknown
You know, you can put chairs on the levee almost, you know, right. There's no sound issues whatsoever. You can play music as loud as you want for as long as you want. Nudity, all the things. Everything is permitted. We just don't. Nobody cares really. What happens after 5 p.m.. So, you know, that's also why we're a somewhat popular venue for, you know, things where people want to be able to be more Burning Man right now, even be themselves.

01:22:06:11 - 01:22:36:06
Unknown
So, like, you know, can can be as crazy as you wish to be. And no one cares what you look like at all, you know? So but the other option is taking boats so we can take boats from my personal Marina that I own. If you look up starboard, Marina, you'll get my Marina.

01:22:36:08 - 01:22:59:12
Unknown
And in a way, it's kind of. I like it better people. You know, if you don't like boats, you don't like it better. But I think if you want to get the Delta experience, you get a bit of a tour of the Delta. Delta. Yeah. That's a it's and it's not. It's weird. And that's just, if you do it on Google Maps, I think I have more pictures on Google Maps.

01:22:59:14 - 01:23:22:01
Unknown
Oh yeah. Whatever. I don't want to rent it. That's funny. I'm like, I don't really want to advertise it because we already have too many people. Yeah. So there we are. And that'll give you an idea of where it is in relation to, so that's my Marina right there.

01:23:22:03 - 01:23:46:05
Unknown
And so, you know, they come in to the Marina and they board a boat, and then we boat them to Forbes. And that's what I always do for my parties. Wow, that's so cool. Yeah, it's really fun. So let's see you. Can you see some of our violence? Yeah. No. So, you know, I have a sea ray. It's it's how many people you want to fit?

01:23:46:06 - 01:24:09:22
Unknown
Sort of 20. We have the big navy ship that we can actually, it drives so we can drive it to a location and bring people out to it with a quick pop pop with a fast boat. Or you can take a very pretty one hour, 45 and about 45 minutes to an hour boat ride from starboard Marina fairly very slowly through the Delta because it's a five mile zone.

01:24:10:05 - 01:24:38:13
Unknown
You're not going very far to Bradford, but you're going very slow to Bradford. So if you look, we're winding down that river. See that big white knee thing. Right. And then I believe. Yeah. Yeah. And out and up. Right. So you're getting like that take it takes about 45 minutes to an hour. It's fun now you know it's a beautiful little trip because you're actually seeing like all the different boats and properties and you know, nature.

01:24:38:13 - 01:24:59:16
Unknown
So because you're going through that channel like move your cursor. Can I see your cursor I don't know, can you I can't tell I can, I can now I can see that you're just taking that route. Right. That say that windy little slower out right there. Yeah. And then you have this tiny bit of very happy fast water and it goes up and then you're up in Forbes.

01:25:00:11 - 01:25:30:09
Unknown
But this little windy is about, you know, 30 to 45 minutes because it's all five mile an hour. But, you know, that allows you to have much more freedom in, timing because we can run ferries whenever you want. People could leave at 2 a.m. on Saturday if they wanted, and you can charge them for that. You know, like we asked for a $20 donation per person and sometimes we actually make more money than the cost of the ferry on that.

01:25:30:11 - 01:26:04:21
Unknown
So the other option is, like I said, taking the big boat, parking it not not necessarily to my Marina, but to my friend's Marina, parking it. They're going I in a like a two minute jaunt out to wider water because you know that it's a big boat. So it has a big draft, so we can't take it in the narrow cats by his docks, but we can take it, park it in advance, shuttle people out few minutes, get the whole boat loaded up and take everybody out at once.

01:26:04:21 - 01:26:30:23
Unknown
And that's about, 15 or 20 minutes. So, I mean, this where the Marina is? Yeah. Oh, I see there's a bridge here. Okay. Yeah, there's a bridge. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So. So if you don't take the boat, how do you get to, this landing here? You drive there and you drive your car on to the boat, onto the ferry, and the ferry drives your car to Bradford Island.

01:26:31:00 - 01:27:02:24
Unknown
You then drive to Forbes Island and bring all your camp gear. Wow. Yeah. Pretty epic. It's pretty epic. Yeah. That's like the whole thing. That's where I want to. Like I said, the conference. So yeah, it's been a great trip, you know, especially for people who've never done it. It's like pretty awesome. Yeah I could see that. So yeah, it seems like we would want people showing up getting ready Friday.

01:27:03:01 - 01:27:26:14
Unknown
Yeah, yeah. Doing the thing all Saturday and into the night and then leaving Sunday. I think it's much easier all the way around for that. And you can still do both. You can have people that want to pay to go on the boat ride, you know, and the people that just want to go on the ferry. Yeah. And ideally we would we to be able to know all like, oh, I foresee it.

01:27:26:16 - 01:27:44:22
Unknown
Yeah. We don't have it all planned beforehand. So we have to have it all planned out like this for the different options. So we know how many people are doing this and how many people are doing that. And all the things. And so the way to do that, that I yes, I have fumbled this ball and picked it up and still win, but oh my goodness, you have no idea.

01:27:44:24 - 01:28:06:19
Unknown
Like I had one guy tell me, oh, we have about 20 people going on the boat. And then at some point he decided to just tell everybody, go on the boat. And there were 200 people waiting for us. It took seven hours to get them all ready. Yeah. You happen to have like a website or something where you've explained this before that we could.

01:28:06:21 - 01:28:29:04
Unknown
Yes. Yes. Yeah. Thousands of write ups and diagrams and and ferry etiquette and be nice to your ferry drivers and bring an apple if you want. You know all of it. We have it all written up. So I have I have now hosted two parties of my own there. So from those experiences I was able to make paperwork that makes it doable, right?

01:28:29:09 - 01:28:50:13
Unknown
We even have, in the works, a video of us driving to the ferry so that people are like, yes, go over this bridge and then cut and then when we get to the ferry where you park, the etiquette of getting on, actually physically seeing the ferry driver come up to you. And that is the best way to do it, really got it.

01:28:50:13 - 01:29:15:04
Unknown
So, yeah. I'd love I'd love to see all that so we can prepare it. Ideally, we would have all of this on a website. Yes. By the end of the year. Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah. There's also, like a welcome package that we give to people for the Airbnb and stuff that has, you know, in and out staff for the people hosting it.

01:29:15:06 - 01:29:36:08
Unknown
So that can give you all your info too. I mean, it's more geared for people who are paying, so things are more expensive, but, but at least it'll tell you all the logistics of it. Okay. Amazing. Yeah. Or crazy, I don't know. Yeah, yeah. But, Madison to take care of everything. So I'm not too worried about it.

01:29:36:08 - 01:29:55:08
Unknown
I got it. But here's the thing. I have created forms now because forms are fabulous. So when they buy their ticket, they go to the form. They pick their ferry, it puts them on a spreadsheet for us. And we don't have to do as much work as I used to write. I used to have to ask a question or whatever.

01:29:55:08 - 01:30:15:16
Unknown
So now it's like, why the ticket? Go to this form first come, first serve. Otherwise you're at a ferry. You don't want to go on, you know, now you're coming at three, you know, so people tend to go to that form and fill it out pretty quickly. Plus then you have all their information, you have anything, you know, you know who's coming, you know what time they're coming at.

01:30:15:21 - 01:30:34:12
Unknown
You know who you left behind. You know, it was getting. So we had like, we were doing phone chains, right? With everybody who's supposed to be on the ferry, which worked better than just like, do we have everybody? I don't know, you know, like it is we have gone through this enough now. I think that it's it's pretty easy.

01:30:34:23 - 01:30:58:05
Unknown
Regarding selling tickets. Yeah. Suggest anything for that or, You mean in what way? Like what platform or. Well. Well, I mean, I was thinking that we like it would be the contribution would be like the give us. And then they would then I guess, I mean, if it's all, oh man, if they're all anon wallets, that would be so I have to figure this out.

01:30:58:07 - 01:31:21:23
Unknown
Okay. So give it the be like a contribution on giveth and then the after that contribution it would be to have them we would have to be able to get them up the packet of information for the tech for everything. So I feel like that's what would happen is they would make the contribution to the giveth campaign, and then that would kick a packet of all of the information to them.

01:31:21:23 - 01:31:48:15
Unknown
That would then lead them to the forms that Haiti has. Yeah, yeah. And then you'd have something you could compare and we could actually write to them in to the, you know, bundle, write to them and say, hey, don't forget your form. Yeah. Okay. Well, I, I think I've taken in enough information now, I know it's so much I know, now that Matty and I will have to discuss some of the finer details.

01:31:48:20 - 01:32:13:05
Unknown
Perfect, perfect. Yeah, I know that as far as time goes, I've found that's like having 11 be when you expect people after the Saturday to be, like, alive and leaving, you know, getting ready to leave that works after the Friday. People are pretty calm on the Friday if you don't give them something to stay up for, right?

01:32:13:07 - 01:32:37:04
Unknown
So maybe avoid too much. I mean, maybe, maybe there's like a DJ or something, but it ends at midnight or something, you know, so that, you know, they'll be up the next day. And I think like letting people to have giving them like if we're going to be either serving breakfast or ordering breakfast or having somebody open with breakfast, handling.

01:32:37:04 - 01:33:05:00
Unknown
So many of us, these people are trying to put solar in my house. That's right. So, you know, starting like 1130 ish, you know, some people can get their food and kind of get away because it is a camping event, you know? So you want them to be alert, you know, either somewhere around 1130 or 1 is always good, cool and beautiful weather at that time.

01:33:05:00 - 01:33:29:07
Unknown
Right? Great. So keep that in mind. What kind of scheduling speaking or any of that stuff? Yeah, I like the idea of the food trucks too. They I guess, take the ferry over, they take the ferry and they stay. Yeah. A food truck does sound good. It takes a little bit off of our plate. So much easier.

01:33:29:10 - 01:33:49:19
Unknown
Oh my goodness. Because the clean up and the cooking in there, that's. Yeah, it's cooking's a lot. And if there's like a can of kitchen, we could that's set up. We could, you know, promote community meals, but we're not in charge of it. I agree, I think really the expense can be in the food that, you know, that's where a lot of losses is in food.

01:33:50:10 - 01:34:25:09
Unknown
I would also suggest, you know, after the conference part, you have a bar that you do suggested donations. And just pick like 2 or 3 drinks, you know, like, whatever. You know, we name something Earth Party or something, and now you pick your, your names of your drinks, you have, like, a Viking drink and, rum drink and, tequila drink, you know, and that way you're not having to really, like, have a, have a bartender that really mixes a whole bunch of different things.

01:34:25:09 - 01:34:45:08
Unknown
You can have these pre-mixed drinks, and people like them. It's kind of funny, you know, and you have them in a, like, a big container that's, you know, health. But I do have a bartender. So either you take shifts at the bartending, right? Or you we I do have a bartender locally who's willing to come and bartend and barely makes any money.

01:34:45:08 - 01:35:08:03
Unknown
It's actually ridiculous. But I think he charges, like, say, like minimum wage, 16 bucks an hour because he makes good tips and wants to. Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, ideally, like we do that, you know, we get the numbers where we can pay everybody a decent chunk. I think the hard part for us is because logistically, you're there, I'm here and there is a lot of pre work.

01:35:08:03 - 01:35:33:01
Unknown
I mean, not a lot, but certainly like that Thursday is the load in. And yeah I mean ideally I'd come out there like a week early. Do we have people coming as helpers in any way. I mean we, I ideally we would I've got one person that I know of that she runs first, produces festivals and stuff, and she charges like thousand dollars for being like the fucking person that runs shit.

01:35:33:08 - 01:35:52:03
Unknown
But she charging $1,000 each. Yeah. I mean, that's what she told me. It was like I was like, whatever. Like, I'm not going to argue with you. But, you know, I think we should probably get to have, like, a small team, of a couple people beyond just us. Because I definitely need to be in just organizing mode.

01:35:52:03 - 01:36:18:15
Unknown
I'm going to need to be in, like, networking mode and being like, oh, I'm building relationships here, and I can't have time to go, like, jeez, I'll just sit here and there. But like, I do find being more of the like organizing around the the party part, you know, the, the person making sure people find where they're going and things because, you know, I think that, you know, YouTube can come in.

01:36:18:17 - 01:36:40:15
Unknown
I don't want you guys to have to work too hard after flying in during or I'm down to, like, work as hard as super hard. I think the biggest thing is just making sure that you want to be able to network and talk. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Like we're going to meet. Yeah, exactly. But I do think we'll be able to, ideally we'll be able to pull in 2 or 3 other people that I know life would be super.

01:36:40:15 - 01:37:01:06
Unknown
Life's going to be fully on board for this. And he's a great host and persona energy to have around and guide. Honestly, if you guys want to come early, you know, and stay at Forbes, you're more than welcome to. So yeah, I think ideally I would want to be I'd come out at least a week early, and then we'll do it.

01:37:01:08 - 01:37:30:12
Unknown
Then we could have it all fixed up and slowly done, which is fabulous. Yeah. So, once we pick those dates, I can look at any rentals around that. We don't have a ton yet in in June. So I think other than that last weekend, which it's really early for people booking. So as soon as we can figure out that we can put that on our calendar to hold those dates from Airbnb and hip camp.

01:37:30:14 - 01:37:54:11
Unknown
Okay, cool. Yeah. So I think me and Greg want to get this pretty much, dialed in and ready to start kind of reaching out to contacts. Yeah, certainly this January 1st. Yeah, certainly speakers. And like, I don't know exactly. You know, like so for example, Brewster, he spends a ton of July and June out here at my house helping with Electric Avenue.

01:37:54:13 - 01:38:16:16
Unknown
So like, they're already in the mode of coming out. So it's not that it's not that hard to get them out if we give them an advance notice. Great. Cool. I'm excited. This is going to be two. I feel really good about it. Know if you need any kind of. I think I'll have you guys chat because you have a better basis of what you're the sales start, end of it, sales pitch, end of it.

01:38:16:16 - 01:38:35:23
Unknown
And that. Yeah. Yeah it and then like, maybe just bring me in when you have some ideas with some like Flo and I can help that flow and suggestions on that, that sounds great. Okay, cool cool. All right. I have to go do a whole bunch of stuff because I have a lavender planting tomorrow with you. All right.

01:38:35:23 - 01:38:58:15
Unknown
We love you, Heidi. Also, we're going to be getting our first $500 grant in early January for to get for support grant writing and for the Boulder grants. And maybe we should start looking at events. And it's in our area too. We could even look at local, art grants around here for this. Yeah, cool San Francisco arts collective and things.

01:38:58:15 - 01:39:20:23
Unknown
Sometimes they'll fund some some of that stuff that's, San Francisco people going to things. So maybe we can find some of that too. Cool, cool. All right, folks, all right. Cool. I'll dip in with Indian is big. I have a bunch of crypto people tomorrow, and if it seems viable, then we'll open some, investigate him a little bit and tell me your thoughts on it.

01:39:21:00 - 01:39:32:00
Unknown
Cool. Sounds great. All right. Wonderful. I so happy Friday. Friday. Love, guys. Bye, love. Yeah. Thanks for everything. But I.
