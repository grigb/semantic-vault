# Boulder Artists Focus Group

I attended a focus group presented by the Boulder Arts Commission. It was an open conversation with 10 artists from the community about our experience on being an artist in Boulder. The overall sentiment that there was a lot of great talent, orgs and pockets of creative work being done but there was an overall lack of cohesion and larger community awareness as to what was happening. 

Some of the discussion was about how Boulder as a city and community talk about how important the arts are but seems like a bit of lip service though the resent tax that was passed lass election cycle that kicks in 2025 is seen as a hope the city is moving in positive direction in terms of support.  We discussed how art needs to be seen as an added value proposition that enriches the community vs a little side novelty. 

Another major pain point was the cost of living and lack of affordable housing/studio space. 

There was a general consensus that Boulder is a particularly difficult art community to be successful in. Many of the artists had been other places like Santa Fe where there was a locus of community which generally created an energy to develop towards a working career. 

Pain points 

- lack of promotion to community at large
- grants only able to support bare minimum of operations
- cost of housing/studio
- spaces scattered across town no focal points
- lack of galleries downtown area and around town at large. mainly due to cost of rent

A thought that has come up around housing is can DC come up with a way to connect artists for collective bargaining in the housing market? Support them in fractional ownership of a house thatâ€™s dedicated to supporting creatives. Also insurance and other  basic needs. How can we support collective bargaining in issues like this?
