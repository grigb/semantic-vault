(Longer Description for LAN)

**LANs: Building Blocks of the Distributed Creatives Ecosystem**

LANs, or Local Artists Networks, are essential components of the Distributed Creatives platform. Each LAN serves as a digital overlay for a specific local art economy, connecting artists, businesses, and art enthusiasts within that community.

**Key Features of LANs:**

- **Distributed Governance:** LANs operate under a distributed governance model, allowing local communities to set their own priorities, allocate funding, and make decisions within a predefined framework.
- **Community-Driven Development:** LANs are developed and managed by the local art community, ensuring that their needs and priorities are at the forefront.
- **Shared Infrastructure:** LANs benefit from the shared infrastructure and resources provided by the Distributed Creatives platform, such as blockchain technology, payment processing, and marketing tools.

By creating a network of interconnected LANs, Distributed Creatives empowers local art economies while fostering a global community of artists, businesses, and enthusiasts. This distributed approach ensures that the benefits of creativity and collaboration are shared equitably, both locally and globally.

Distributed Creatives:
Igniting a Global Creative Renaissance
Art as a Human Right
Art is an intrinsic human right—a natural eruption of energy that flows through humanity like a geyser from deep within.
We envision a future where art is 
unshackled from commercial constraints, where artists no longer compete 
for a limited spotlight or suppress their creative visions to fit 
trending narratives. For too long, artists have been forced into the 
archetype of the starving creator—passionate individuals seen as mad by 
society, forsaking comfort because their pursuits rarely yield 
sufficient resources.
As we enter the fourth decade of the digital revolution, we have an unprecedented opportunity to rewrite this story. 
**Distributed Creatives** aims to liberate artists to create from a place of full resource, fueling a more beautiful tomorrow for everyone.

## **Introduction**

### **Our Vision and Passion**

As artists and technologists deeply embedded in the creative
